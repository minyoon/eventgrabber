These rare and amazingly well-preserved works by early landscape and bird-and-flower painters of the late Song and early Yuan periods (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), rendered on silk or paper with ink and light color, demonstrate the sophistication and accomplishment of the early Chinese painting tradition.<br />
<br />
Early Chinese painters often depicted the natural world through a lens of gentle mists created by delicate brushwork. Whether capturing a refined corner of the universe, as in Ma Yuans thirteenth-century Plum Tree and Ducks by a Stream, or a single twisted branch of a grapevine, as in Wen Riguans thirteenth-century Grapes, it is the artists control of ink, wash, and line that brings the subject to life. Equally compelling is the anonymous Fish and Water Plants from the fifteenth century, which depicts a powerful carp rising through a bed of delicately rendered vegetation; the very light touches of color in this work add a pleasing naturalism to the scene.<br />
<br />
Landscape painters, too, conveyed the beauty and grandeur of the natural world. Their interpretations were not intended to be of specific places rendered in realistic terms, but rather idealized landscapes of retreat and reclusion. The tall trees of Guo Mins Fir and Pines in the Snow (thirteenth century) form a protective circle around a figure pictured in a hut at the base of a fantastic and turbulent mountain. The artist concedes that man is but a small part of a much grander universe. Similarly, River Landscape, attributed to Ma Wan (1325-1365), suggests the glory of the natural world with a remote view that allows the viewer to survey the landscape of mountains, trees, and streams.<br />
<br />
This fall at BAM/PFA, you have a wonderful opportunity to see how the rich painting tradition established by these early artists, especially the careful observation of the natural world, continues to inform and inspire with the exhibition Yang Fudong: Estranged Paradise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gazing into Nature is organized by Senior Curator for Asian Art Julia M. White."
"Deities, Demons, and Teachers of Tibet, Nepal, and India, thru Apr 13, 2014",2013-10-13,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67216&date=2013-10-13,"Joyful and sensual sculptural figures of Indian deities and dancers join radiant images of enlightened beings from Tibet and Nepal in Deities, Demons, and Teachers, which presents a rotating display of works by anonymous Indian, Nepalese, and Tibetan artisans. A tenth-century sandstone figure of Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity worshipped by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, graces the entrance to the exhibition, a site appropriate to Ganeshas role in removing obstacles and blessing any new endeavor. Whether viewed as a cosmic dancer or a cavorting adolescent, this image of Ganesha is confirmation of the wonder and delight to be found in the sculpture and painting of these ancient cultures.<br />
<br />
Hindus and Buddhists both revere and celebrate female deities and often depict goddesses in idealized form with exaggerated marks of beauty. In Dancing Devi, a twelfth-century buff-sandstone sculpture from central India, the beauty of the bejeweled and crowned figure is accentuated by the larger-than-life proportions of breasts and buttocks. A more reserved but no less beautifully idealized feminine form is seen in Tara, a seventeenth-century Nepalese bronze, where the figure is surrounded by a fanciful garden of birds, musicians, and garlands.<br />
<br />
Very early images of the Buddha are rare, so it is quite exceptional that in addition to the massive bronze fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddha in the center of the gallery, this exhibition also features a stone image of a third-century seated Buddha from the Swat Valley and a tenth- or eleventh-century bronze Standing Buddha from Western Tibet. An array of bodhisattvas and attendant deities from these regions, including a painting of the Thirteenth Karmapa (at left), believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, fill out the gathered celestial realm of the Buddhist cosmology.<br />

"Yang Fudong, thru Dec 8",2013-10-13,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=68529&date=2013-10-13,"This first midcareer survey of the work of Yang Fudong (b. 1971) presents films, multichannel videos, and photographs by a leading figure in Chinas contemporary art world and independent cinema movement.<br />
<br />
Yangs work reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation born during and after the Cultural Revolution that is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China. Although he draws much of his subject matter from the consumerist contexts of contemporary urban China, many of his images recall the literati paintings of seventeenth-century China (Yang first trained in painting before switching to photography and filmmaking). His films and film installations have an atemporal and dreamlike quality, marked by long and suspended sequences, dividing narratives, and multiple relationships and storylines. In his recent installations, Yang reflects on the process of filmmaking itself, creating spatially open-ended multichannel films that he calls a contemporary form of the Chinese hand scroll.<br />
<br />
Our presentation of Yangs work includes twenty years of photographs and video and film installations in the galleries; a film series at the PFA Theater co-curated by the artist that focuses on works that have influenced him, ranging from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema of the 1930s and 1940s to the Fifth Generation filmmakers who rose to prominence in the 1980s; and a continuous loop of Yangs single-channel films daily at midday in the Museum Theater. <br />
<br />

The Earth as Seen from the Moon is Pasolinis episode in Le streghe (The Witches), produced by Dino De Laurentiis. Pasolini features Tot and Ninetto Davoli (the team from Hawks and Sparrows) as an eccentric old widower and his half-wit son. They are visited by a deaf-mute beauty, Silvana Mangano, who sets about putting their squalid existence into domestic order. Filmed in fantastic colors that, apart from Davolis green hair, reflect those Pasolini found in such impoverished seaside resort areas as Ostia, The Earth as Seen from the Moon is a surrealist fable. Its characters, Pasolini noted, were not so much creations as exaggerations of what Pasolini saw in the clownish Tot and the magical Davoli. What Are the Clouds?, Pasolinis segment of De Laurentiis Capriccio allitaliana, again features Tot, along with other popular Italian comics chosen by Pasolini for their plebeian quality. The film draws on popular puppet theater in retelling the story of Othello using human puppets: Ninetto Davoli as Othello, Laura Betti as Desdemona, and Tot as Iago. The Paper Flower Sequence, Pasolinis episode in Amore e rabbia (Love and Anger), is based on the Gospel parable of the innocent fig treein which Christ curses the fig tree that has not yet produced its fruit because it is only March. Ninetto Davoli is pictured walking up the Via Nazionale without a thought in his head, as global events pass above him like shadows. Though God exhorts him to be aware, like the fig tree he does not understand (Pasolini). The film concludes that there are moments in history when one cannot be innocent . . . when not to be aware is to be guilty."

Fassbinder drew on a true story of a fellow who was driven to murder a man he didnt know but who looked like his father. Peter (Vitus Zeplichal) is a depressed bricklayer who becomes a kind of shockworker on behalf of mortgage and wife, mistakenly believing he must buy even her love. Probing Peters past, and his hardworking and cruelly if normally unappreciative parents, the film shows why. Village Voice film critic J. Hoberman wrote: I Only Want You to Love Me is enlivened by the blank reaction shots, stagy mise-en-scne, and endless parody of German uptightness that are Fassbinder trademarks. . . . Whats most powerful about the movie is also whats most banal: the source of Peters rage is his traumatic family romance. . . . Fassbinder based (the film) on interviews with convicted killers but informed it with memories of his own unhappy childhood.<br />

"Imaginations: Paintings by Bill A. Dallas, thru Jan 3, 2014",2013-10-14,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69478&date=2013-10-14,"Artist Bill A. Dallas was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up surrounded by great music, the famous Kansas City blues and jazz. Music had a profound effect on him as a young man, but he discovered his true talent in painting after his move to Berkeley, California in 1963. He earned a BFA from UC Berkeley in 1974.<br />
<br />
Currently living and painting in Oakland, Dallas is a versatile painter who incorporates calligraphy, figure studies and abstract painting into his work. A traveler whenever possible, Dallas has visited more than 25 countries. During his travels to Japan he studied calligraphy, woodblock printing, handmade paper and Sumi ink brush painting with master artist Toshi Yoshida. Yet, music remains an important part of his practice and he paints almost exclusively while listening to jazz. His two-handed, brushless style of painting is unique; he calls his style artmatism. The divine principle of true artmatism painting is to be in a constant state of enlightenment, states Dallas. Freedom first, then comes enlightenment, and with that enlightenment you understand division and separation of the imaginations. <br />
<br />
Dallas has exhibited throughout the Bay Area and the United States. His work is found in private collections throughout the world, including Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. He was recently included in The Kinsey Collection: Shared Treasures of Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, an exhibition at San Franciscos Museum of the African Diaspora."

Jaron Lanier is a computer scientist, composer, visual artist, and author. His scientific interests include biomimetic information architectures, user interfaces, heterogeneous scientific simulations, advanced information systems for medicine, and computational approaches to the fundamentals of physics. He collaborates with a wide range of scientists in fields related to these interests. <br />
<br />
Lanier's name is also often associated with Virtual Reality research. He either coined or popularized the term 'Virtual Reality' and in the early 1980s founded VPL Research, the first company to sell VR products. In the late 1980s he led the team that developed the first implementations of multi-person virtual worlds using head mounted displays, for both local and wide area networks, as well as the first ""avatars"", or representations of users within such systems. While at VPL, he and his colleagues developed the first implementations of virtual reality applications in surgical simulation, vehicle interior prototyping, virtual sets for television production, and assorted other areas. He led the team that developed the first widely used software platform architecture for immersive virtual reality applications. Sun Microsystems acquired VPL's seminal portfolio of patents related to Virtual Reality and networked 3D graphics in 1999.<br />
<br />
From 1997 to 2001, Lanier was the Chief Scientist of Advanced Network and Services, which contained the Engineering Office of Internet2, and served as the Lead Scientist of the National Tele-immersion Initiative, a coalition of research universities studying advanced applications for Internet2. The Initiative demonstrated the first prototypes of tele-immersion in 2000 after a three-year development period. From 2001 to 2004 he was Visiting Scientist at Silicon Graphics Inc., where he developed solutions to core problems in telepresence and tele-immersion. He was Scholar at Large for Microsoft from 2006 to 2009, and Partner Architect at Microsoft Research from 2009 forward.<br />
<br />
Lanier has received honorary doctorates from the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Franklin and Marshall College, was the recipient of CMU's Watson award in 2001, was a finalist for the first Edge of Computation Award in 2005, and received a Lifetime Career Award from the IEEE in 2009 for contributions to Virtual Reality."

While their study was initiated almost 75 years, very little is still known about them, and one of the main problems of algebraic combinatorics is to find a positive combinatorial interpretation for them. Recently, this problem found a new meaning in the field of Geometric Complexity Theory initiated by Mulmuley and Sohoni, where certain conjectures on the complexity of computing and deciding positivity of Kronecker coefficients are part of a program to prove the ``P vs NP'' Millennium problem. In this talk we will describe several problems and some results on different aspects of the Kronecker coefficients. One is Saxl's conejecture stating that the tensor square $S_\rho \otimes S_\rho$, where $\rho$ is the staircase partition and $S_\lambda$ is the corresponding Specht module, contains every irreducible representation of $S_n$. We will also present some results on complexity related to Mulmuley's conjectures. Last, but not least, we explore the combinatorial aspect of the problem and show how to prove certain unimodality results using Kronecker coefficients, including Sylvester's theorem on the unimodality of $q$-binomial coefficients (as polynomials in $q$)."
"Resilience: An Engineering Challenge, Oct 14",2013-10-14,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=71278&date=2013-10-14,"Risk modeling has focused on the ""3Ds: Deaths, Dollars and Downtime"" as metrics for estimating building and infrastructure performance as well as for decision-making in design and in policy development. What can these metrics tell us about performance and resilience in recent disasters? What other measures of performance are suggested by the recovery experience in both developed and developing countries? What are the engineering challenges and research opportunities coming out of recent earthquakes in China, Haiti, Chile, New Zealand and Japan, and how are they applicable to the U.S. context? Are there better engineering metrics for resilience?<br />
<br />
Engineering performance metrics typically are designed for individual components (e.g. for a building or bridge), not for a city. Resilience requires metrics that look at the performance of community components such as housing, education, civic and cultural infrastructure. Evaluating recovery experience in recent earthquakes, it is clear that funding, political will, creative planning, and good technical implementation drive the speed and quality of recovery.<br />
<br />
To improve resilience, our professions need to participate in land use and policy planning; and we need to re-think performance measures and building codes in order to develop methods of setting performance guidelines for cities. Improving overall performance and resilience in developed countries with good codes and land use practices, as well as in developing countries, are challenges for the 21st Century."

Twenty years later, in 2011, Myanmars long-standing military junta finally did give way to a nominally civilian government, and soon thereafter the terrain of liberal freedom unquestionably expanded. Yet today there is still fear in Myanmar. Partly, it is vertical: ongoing fear of the state and its agents. Partly, it is horizontal: resurgent fear of society and the institutions, associations and identities that constitute it. Partly, it is in some sense inbred: deep-seated fear as a habit of mind after so many years of dictatorship. The talk considers how Myanmars unfolding reform process is extending freedom, and at the same time how it might address prevalent fear. <br />
<br />
Ian Holliday (Ph.D., Oxford) focuses his current research on political reform in Myanmar. His most recent book is <i>Burma Redux: Global Justice and the Quest for Political Reform in Myanmar</i> (Columbia University Press, 2011). His classroom teaching addresses dilemmas of humanitarian intervention. Each year he also takes around 50 students to Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand to deliver intensive English language training in marginalized and impoverished communities. From 2006 to 2011, he was Dean of Social Sciences at the University of Hong Kong."

<b>Paper Abstract</b><br />
How do courts at the grassroots level in India approach and address economic and other civil litigation cases brought by litigants? During 2010, 2011, and 2012, a team of researchers from academia and civil society organizations conducted extensive ethnographies of litigants, judges, lawyers, and courtroom personnel within multiple districts in three states: Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra. Our research provides an in-depth account of the everyday struggles these actors face in the pursuit of their respective objectives. As the findings suggest, there exists a complex matrix of variables that affect: whether lawsuits are filed in the first place; how they are handled once in a legal forum; what legal strategies lawyers employ when litigation occurs; and how cases are adjudicated by judges. The results of this study offer competing, yet also complimentary, narratives. On the one hand, there is immense despair, frustration, and anger among the various sets of respondents on the current state of legal life at the grassroots. At the same time, however, there is a surprising level of hope and optimism towards what the law and the lower courts can potentially  and at times do  offer. This sentiment, as we show, is held by those working within this environment, and more significantly, by litigants desperately seeking to gain relief from long-endured grievances. <br />

Coarse-graining techniques, Markov state models for example, are employed to reduce the degree of freedom of the system, and hence enables simulation and understanding of the system on a long time scale. In this talk, we will introduce a novel construction of Markov state model based on milestoning. We will discuss the quality of approximation when the original system is metastable. The analysis is based on transition path theory. The analysis identifies quantitative criteria which enable automatic identification of metastable sets."

This makes it important to study interstellar turbulence using the strengths of numerical studies combined with observational studies. I shall discuss progress that has been made in the development of new techniques for comparing observational data with numerical MHD simulations in the molecular medium, in neutral gas as traced by HI, and warm ionized gas as traced by synchrotron polarization."

In a joint work with Pierre Germain (Courant Institute), I established an existence and compactness theory for this problem and analyzed the vanishing viscosity--capillarity limit for weak solutions with finite energy to the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system. This new method leads to a generalization of DiPerna's theorem (bounded solutions) and LeFloch-Westdickenberg's theorem (finite energy solutions) to the Euler system of polytropic fluids."

We discuss three concrete problems characterized by incomplete information about an object of interest. The first is the century-old phase retrieval problem where intensity-only measurementsphase information is completely missingare available about an image as in X-ray crystallography, and we wish to recover the phase. The second is a problem in data analysis, where we observe only a few entries in a data matrixfor instance users' preferences for a collection of itemswhich may have been further corrupted, and we wish to infer reliably all the missing and corrupted entries. The third is the super-resolution problem where one can only observe the low-frequencies of a signal and/or image due to physical laws, and wish to recover the high-end of its spectrum as to 'beat' the diffraction limit. To retrieve what seems lost, we describe three simple solutions with a common theme, namely, the use of ideas from semidefinite programming. We present some theory explaining when one can and cannot expect these methods to provide accurate answers, as well as some applications.<br />

My interpretations of these films will differ significantly from the existing academic analyses (heavily psychoanalytic or otherwise textually-focused) in that I will try to illuminate these films in view of their interactions with the genre conventions of war film, as well as in relation to the changing socio-cultural perceptions of the post-liberation history and the Korean War that cannot be entirely attributed to shifting tides in the politics of left and right. I will hopefully demonstrate that, instead of simply following the (elite- or media-generated) politically charged understanding of the post-liberation history, these films are reflecting complex patterns of interaction among cinematic conventions, cultural habitus, select invocation of memories and historical data, and the anxieties and fantasies of contemporary Koreans in relation to global modernity."

<br />
It is commonly assumed that the historicization of religion and theology only occurred in the wake of an early enlightenment, and against the forces of confessionalisation and dogmatic theology. I will argue that in England the process occurred much earlier, and crucially, at the service of confessional identity. Due to structural changes in the nature of theology tuitionmost of the evidence for which remains hidden in untapped manuscript sourcesEnglish divines invested both materially and intellectually in leading European scholarship. This led them to some remarkable speculation on the history of the biblical text, and on the relationship between the Judeo-Christian tradition and paganism, whether between the biblical Jews and the ancient Egyptians and Zoroastrians, or between early Christians and Hellenistic philosophy. It was this confessionalised investment in erudition, rather than tolerationist politics or explicit opposition to clerical learning, that had the most profound impact on attitudes to faith in early modern England. <br />
<br />
Dmitri Levitin is a historian of early modern British and European intellectual and religious culture. He received his PhD at Selwyn College, Cambridge, before moving to a Research Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge. He has recently been appointed to a Chancellor's Fellowship at the University of Edinburgh, and is currently spending two months as a visiting scholar at the Folger Library in Washington D.C. He has published on various aspects of early modern history of scholarship, history of science and history of religion, and his first book, entitled Ancient Wisdom in the Age of the New Science: Histories of Philosophy in Seventeenth-Century England, is due out next year.<br />

How have digital artists tried to work through the visual politics of racial identities? What is at stake in the ""skin play"" available to those who inhabit artificial worlds? How do such representations imply a certain ethics of social relation? In the 2009 essay ""The Face and The Public: Race, Secrecy and Digital Art Practice "" some of these questions are explored in the form of a critical response to theorists, such as Mark Hansen, who argue for the internet as a racially neutral domain. In this talk, Jennifer Gonzlez will delve into the interplay of race and art in new media, using the arts to discuss the evolution of racial representation in the digital age.<br />
<br />
Jennifer A. Gonzlez teaches in the History of Art and Visual Culture department at the University of California, Santa Cruz and at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program, New York. She has written for numerous periodicals including ""Aztln,"" ""Frieze,"" ""Bomb,"" ""Camera Obscura,"" and ""Art Journal."" Her essays about cyborg bodies and racial embodiment in digital art can be found in anthologies like ""The Cyborg Handbook"" (1995) and ""Race in Cyberspace"" (2000). Her book ""Subject to Display: Reframing Race in Contemporary Installation Art"" (MIT Press, 2008) was a finalist for the Charles Rufus Morey Book Award.<br />

Magnes Museum commissioned Albert Garvey (Chicago, 1932), a photographer, printmaker, and graphic designer then based in Fairfax, California, to create a portfolio of views of contemporary Israel. This commission, unconventional for its time, resulted in the work, We Are the Wall Itself, a collection of twenty-four even more unconventional serigraphs (color silkscreen prints), based on images taken by the artist and his wife, Barbara, first in 1960 and again in the spring of 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War.<br />
<br />
Starting from over one thousand 35mm. photographs, altered in the darkroom and combined with hand-drawn stencils, Garvey depicted religious gatherings, the walls and the streets of Jerusalem, the urbanization of Eilat, agricultural work in the kibbutz, and the emerging youth counterculture.<br />
<br />
By presenting a selection from the original project, we are revisiting two sets of cultural conventions: those connected to the artistic practice of imaging the Holy Land, as well as the ways in which the State of Israel has commonly been portrayed since its founding in 1948. Emblematic of the unique view of modern Israel that emerged out of California in the 1960s and early 1970s, Garveys eye seized Israels diversity through the lenses of a then popular form of Pop Art (screen printing), distant from the tropes that had until then marked its representation in America and elsewhere. Rather than glorifying military might, agricultural advancements, and archeological treasures, these images offer a direct appreciation for the daily life of a developing country in which multiple cultures continually negotiated their forms of coexistence.<br />

The exhibition includes over one hundred individual items, many of which were never catalogued before.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a dynamic collecting campaign conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, The Magnes became one of the world's most extensive repositories of materials about the Jews of Southern India, along with the historic sites in Kerala and national and private collections in Israel, where most of the Kerala Jews settled after the founding of the State in 1948.<br />
<br />
The collection includes hundreds of ritual objects, textiles, photographs, archival records, Hebrew books, and manuscripts, including liturgical texts, illustrated ketubbot (Jewish marriage contracts) and amulets, in Hebrew, Aramaic, Malayalam, Judeo-Spanish, and English.<br />
<br />
These materials constitute an invaluable source of information on the Kerala Jewish community, one of the oldest in the world, and its deep connections with Indias society and cultures and with the global Jewish Diaspora, across India, the Middle East, and Europe. Among the most notable items on display are the Torah Ark from the Tekkumbhagam synagogue in Mattancherry, Kochi, and an extremely rare amulet on parchment, designed to protect women in childbirth and newborn children.<br />
<br />
This exhibition is the culmination of years of curatorial work devoted to assessing and documenting the holdings of The Magnes Collection, conducted in collaboration with experts in Israel and the US. It also inaugurates a new season of research, engaging the scholarly community at UC Berkeley and beyond, and intersecting Jewish and Asian Studies.<br />

"Imaginations: Paintings by Bill A. Dallas, thru Jan 3, 2014",2013-10-15,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69478&date=2013-10-15,"Artist Bill A. Dallas was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up surrounded by great music, the famous Kansas City blues and jazz. Music had a profound effect on him as a young man, but he discovered his true talent in painting after his move to Berkeley, California in 1963. He earned a BFA from UC Berkeley in 1974.<br />
<br />
Currently living and painting in Oakland, Dallas is a versatile painter who incorporates calligraphy, figure studies and abstract painting into his work. A traveler whenever possible, Dallas has visited more than 25 countries. During his travels to Japan he studied calligraphy, woodblock printing, handmade paper and Sumi ink brush painting with master artist Toshi Yoshida. Yet, music remains an important part of his practice and he paints almost exclusively while listening to jazz. His two-handed, brushless style of painting is unique; he calls his style artmatism. The divine principle of true artmatism painting is to be in a constant state of enlightenment, states Dallas. Freedom first, then comes enlightenment, and with that enlightenment you understand division and separation of the imaginations. <br />
<br />
Dallas has exhibited throughout the Bay Area and the United States. His work is found in private collections throughout the world, including Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. He was recently included in The Kinsey Collection: Shared Treasures of Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, an exhibition at San Franciscos Museum of the African Diaspora."

"Chancellor's Lecture - Topics in Analysis: Hidden convexity in nonlinear PDES, thru Dec 19",2013-10-15,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70675&date=2013-10-15,"Outline: Several examples of hidden convexity in nonlinear PDEs will be addressed. Most of them are related to the theory of optimal transportation, which is the theme of one of the two MSRI programs this fall: see http://www.msri.org/programs/277.<br />
<br />
1) Fully nonlinear elliptic equations: The canonical example is the reduction of the Monge-Amp`ere equation (a fully nonlinear elliptic PDE related to the Minkowski problem in geometry) to a convex minimization problem, `a la Kantorovich, which can be solved by convex duality techniques. Connections with combinatorial optimization and optimal transport will be discussed.<br />
<br />
2) Mathematical fluid mechanics:<br />
i) Some solutions to the Euler equations can be obtained by using the least action principle (following V.I. Arnolds geometric interpretation), leading to the problem of optimal incompressible transport; this problem has a hidden convex structure which provides existence, uniqueness and partial regularity for its solution.<br />
ii) The hydrostatic and semi-geostrophic limits of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are examples of very singular limits that cannot be justified on standard linear functional spaces but can be addressed successfully on suitable convex functional cones.<br />
<br />
3) Electromagnetism and magnetohydrodynamics:<br />
i) The nonlinear theory of electromagnetism by Born and Infeld is described by a system of nonlinear conservation laws (which leads to the standard Maxwell equations for fields of low intensity), which has an interesting hidden structure, showing very easily its hyperbolic nature; the high field limit of the BI equations will be discussed and related to the optimal transport of currents.<br />
ii) The magnetic relaxation equations proposed by Moffatt can be seen as a natural extension to divergence-free vector fields of the scalar heat equation (following the interpretation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto); they form a very degenerate parabolic systems of PDEs with a hidden convex structure that enables us to show the global existence of dissipative solutions (in the spirit of P.-L. Lions and Ambrosio-Gigli-Savare)."

Bowden followed Hoffmann to New York in 1932 and became a founding member of American Abstract Artists in 1936. Bowden exhibited in New York often in group and solo shows during the 30s, but he left for Sausalito in 1942, where he spent the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Bowdens paintings reflect the prevailing currents of his generation, such as an engagement with the development of modern European masters, as well as an early fascination with abstraction that developed over a decade before he returned to figurative painting. This selection of his paintings is supplemented here by a trove a figure studies in pastel, pencil and gouache that he made c. 1950. A group of photographs provide a window on a lifetime practice that resulted in a series of photographic books, murals, and his work being collected and exhibited by the Museum of Modern Art in 1951. Though Bowden never achieved the renown of some of his peers, his works demonstrate an avid imagination, accomplished technique, and a willingness to experiment in multiple mediums.<br />

"Underserved and Overdosed?, Oct 15",2013-10-15,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70915&date=2013-10-15,"During the 2000s, confirmed polio cases in India became increasingly localised in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar, especially amongst Muslim children. Muslims have also been at the sharp end of the Pulse Polio Initiative (PPI) and the associated Underserved Strategy designed to counter civilian resistance to the programme. My critique of the PPI draws on long-term research in rural UP and focuses on the programmes socio-political implications. I discuss popular rumours about polio vaccine and official responses to resistance. Taking a longer-term view of top-down single-issue public health programmes, I argue that Muslims in western UP, as a marginalised minority, have good reason to be suspicious of the PPI. Moreover, the PPI arguably reflects the agendas of global funders, not the priorities of local communities. VillagersHindu and Muslim alikehave repeatedly criticised government health services for failing to deal with the health issues that worry them most. Their concerns echo other critiques of the PPI, particularly the diversion of resources from other health-related activities that could address the social determinants of health and health inequalities.<br />

Most studies of prediction markets outside the lab are from public markets with large trading populations. Corporate prediction markets face additional issues, such as thinness, weak incentives, limited entry and the potential for traders with ulterior motives  raising questions about how well these markets will perform. We examine data from prediction markets run by Google, Ford and Koch Industries. Despite theoretically adverse conditions, we find these markets are relatively efficient, and improve upon the forecasts of experts at all three firms by as much as a 25% reduction in mean squared error. The most notable inefficiency is an optimism bias in the markets at Google and Ford. The inefficiencies that do exist generally become smaller over time. More experienced traders and those with higher past performance trade against the identified inefficiencies, suggesting that the markets efficiency improves because traders gain experience and less skilled traders exit the market."

Well compute its degree, universal Grbner basis, and initial ideals - and tell how to read all of this from the matroid.

Sichuan was a land richly endowed with natural resources, economic products, and manpower. Communication between the two lands was legendary for its difficulty, with two mountain ranges presenting formidable barriers. Despite the harsh terrain, the Qin army managed to invade and conquer the Sichuan Basin in 316 BCE via alpine roads hewn on steep mountainsides. The success provided the Qin with new routes to attack an arch rival, the kingdom of Chu, and a large laboratory and supply base in its quest to establish a unified empire. The Sichuan invasion in 316 BCE therefore constituted a signature moment in the history of China, yet it is far less emphasized in the general story of Qins unification of China compared to its conquest of the six major kingdoms. The present lecture examines the archaeological record of interactions between the Sichuan Basin and the Wei River valley in the early Bronze Age as well as the time before and after 316 BCE, and discusses their expressions in material culture."

Formerly embodied in the infrastructure, architecture, and technology of the cityscape, modernity was reconfigured as a dynamic and transformative force whose possibilities ordinary people came to believe they could harness. The presentation will focus on the articulation of this passage in the public culture of the two milieus, in the contrasting figures of comic vaudeville performers such as Canuplin and Kenkoy and youthful film protagonists like FPJ and Erap.<br />

"DREAM Seminar: Emergent Middleware Facing the Interoperability Challenge, Oct 15",2013-10-15,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70641&date=2013-10-15,"Interoperability is the ability for two systems to exchange, understand and use each other's data, and is a long-standing problem in the field of distributed systems. However, the emergence of pervasive computing and the Internet of Things have brought about new challenges to achieving universal interoperability. Extreme heterogeneity and spontaneous interactions are characteristics of today's complex distributed systems.<br />
<br />
To face the above challenges, we have introduced the notion of Emergent Middleware as part of the European CONNECT project. Emergent middleware ensures interoperation between two networked systems by combining message interoperability, i.e., the ability to interpret messages from/toward networked systems and behavioral interoperability, i.e., the ability to mediate the interaction protocols run by the communicating networked systems, under specified non-functional properties, e.g., reliability, performance and security. On-the-fly production of emergent middleware then relies on the following key enablers within the network: discovery of networked systems, learning of interaction protocols and synthesis of protocol mediators.<br />
<br />
In this talk, after an overview of the Emergent middleware principles, I will detail the proposed solution to automated mediator synthesis, which is based on ontology reasoning and constraint programming in order to infer mappings between components' interfaces automatically. These mappings guarantee semantic compatibility between the operations and data of the interfaces. Then, we analyse the behaviors of components in order to synthesise, if possible, a mediator that coordinates the computed mappings so as to make the components interact properly. Our approach is formally-grounded to ensure the correctness of the synthesized mediator. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by implementing the MICS (Mediator synthesIs to Connect componentS) tool and experimenting it with various real-world case studies.<br />

This ambitious five-venue exhibition and its accompanying programs will provide San Franciscans and Bay Area residents with an opportunity to confront visions for the region that never came to be.<br />
<br />
Each institution will display treasures from archival collections, architecture firms and private collections, and host companion programming. Unbuilt San Francisco at the College of Environmental Design is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers a shadow city and phantom skyline. The curators explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. The exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area."

Magnes Museum commissioned Albert Garvey (Chicago, 1932), a photographer, printmaker, and graphic designer then based in Fairfax, California, to create a portfolio of views of contemporary Israel. This commission, unconventional for its time, resulted in the work, We Are the Wall Itself, a collection of twenty-four even more unconventional serigraphs (color silkscreen prints), based on images taken by the artist and his wife, Barbara, first in 1960 and again in the spring of 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War.<br />
<br />
Starting from over one thousand 35mm. photographs, altered in the darkroom and combined with hand-drawn stencils, Garvey depicted religious gatherings, the walls and the streets of Jerusalem, the urbanization of Eilat, agricultural work in the kibbutz, and the emerging youth counterculture.<br />
<br />
By presenting a selection from the original project, we are revisiting two sets of cultural conventions: those connected to the artistic practice of imaging the Holy Land, as well as the ways in which the State of Israel has commonly been portrayed since its founding in 1948. Emblematic of the unique view of modern Israel that emerged out of California in the 1960s and early 1970s, Garveys eye seized Israels diversity through the lenses of a then popular form of Pop Art (screen printing), distant from the tropes that had until then marked its representation in America and elsewhere. Rather than glorifying military might, agricultural advancements, and archeological treasures, these images offer a direct appreciation for the daily life of a developing country in which multiple cultures continually negotiated their forms of coexistence.<br />

The exhibition includes over one hundred individual items, many of which were never catalogued before.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a dynamic collecting campaign conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, The Magnes became one of the world's most extensive repositories of materials about the Jews of Southern India, along with the historic sites in Kerala and national and private collections in Israel, where most of the Kerala Jews settled after the founding of the State in 1948.<br />
<br />
The collection includes hundreds of ritual objects, textiles, photographs, archival records, Hebrew books, and manuscripts, including liturgical texts, illustrated ketubbot (Jewish marriage contracts) and amulets, in Hebrew, Aramaic, Malayalam, Judeo-Spanish, and English.<br />
<br />
These materials constitute an invaluable source of information on the Kerala Jewish community, one of the oldest in the world, and its deep connections with Indias society and cultures and with the global Jewish Diaspora, across India, the Middle East, and Europe. Among the most notable items on display are the Torah Ark from the Tekkumbhagam synagogue in Mattancherry, Kochi, and an extremely rare amulet on parchment, designed to protect women in childbirth and newborn children.<br />
<br />
This exhibition is the culmination of years of curatorial work devoted to assessing and documenting the holdings of The Magnes Collection, conducted in collaboration with experts in Israel and the US.

George Dysons Turings Cathedral tells part of the story of the sixty years between these two milestones, and is also the focus of this years On the Same Page program, which gives the UC Berkeley campus community something to talk about. The program theme is The Dawn of the Computer Age, which refers both to the time period in which the ENIAC and MANIAC computers were created and also to our own day and age, when progress in technology is occurring so fast that we are only beginning to see and understand the repercussions of the computer age. Check the On the Same Page web site (http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu ) for details on the many opportunities for participating in this campus-wide discussion, both online and in person.<br />

"Imaginations: Paintings by Bill A. Dallas, thru Jan 3, 2014",2013-10-16,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69478&date=2013-10-16,"Artist Bill A. Dallas was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up surrounded by great music, the famous Kansas City blues and jazz. Music had a profound effect on him as a young man, but he discovered his true talent in painting after his move to Berkeley, California in 1963. He earned a BFA from UC Berkeley in 1974.<br />
<br />
Currently living and painting in Oakland, Dallas is a versatile painter who incorporates calligraphy, figure studies and abstract painting into his work. A traveler whenever possible, Dallas has visited more than 25 countries. During his travels to Japan he studied calligraphy, woodblock printing, handmade paper and Sumi ink brush painting with master artist Toshi Yoshida. Yet, music remains an important part of his practice and he paints almost exclusively while listening to jazz. His two-handed, brushless style of painting is unique; he calls his style artmatism. The divine principle of true artmatism painting is to be in a constant state of enlightenment, states Dallas. Freedom first, then comes enlightenment, and with that enlightenment you understand division and separation of the imaginations. <br />
<br />
Dallas has exhibited throughout the Bay Area and the United States. His work is found in private collections throughout the world, including Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. He was recently included in The Kinsey Collection: Shared Treasures of Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, an exhibition at San Franciscos Museum of the African Diaspora."

With the frenzy of Chinas economic growth has come accelerated decay, leaving city and country alike scarred by the relics of past dreams."

That's the moment being explored from a variety of perspectives in Unbuilt San Francisco: Ambition and Imagination. <br />
<br />
At its most basic, the exhibition is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers the shadow city and phantom skyline that never came to be, for better and for worse. In the process, we explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. <br />
<br />
Co-curated by design critic John King and EDA Curator Waverly Lowell, the exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago."

These rare and amazingly well-preserved works by early landscape and bird-and-flower painters of the late Song and early Yuan periods (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), rendered on silk or paper with ink and light color, demonstrate the sophistication and accomplishment of the early Chinese painting tradition.<br />
<br />
Early Chinese painters often depicted the natural world through a lens of gentle mists created by delicate brushwork. Whether capturing a refined corner of the universe, as in Ma Yuans thirteenth-century Plum Tree and Ducks by a Stream, or a single twisted branch of a grapevine, as in Wen Riguans thirteenth-century Grapes, it is the artists control of ink, wash, and line that brings the subject to life. Equally compelling is the anonymous Fish and Water Plants from the fifteenth century, which depicts a powerful carp rising through a bed of delicately rendered vegetation; the very light touches of color in this work add a pleasing naturalism to the scene.<br />
<br />
Landscape painters, too, conveyed the beauty and grandeur of the natural world. Their interpretations were not intended to be of specific places rendered in realistic terms, but rather idealized landscapes of retreat and reclusion. The tall trees of Guo Mins Fir and Pines in the Snow (thirteenth century) form a protective circle around a figure pictured in a hut at the base of a fantastic and turbulent mountain. The artist concedes that man is but a small part of a much grander universe. Similarly, River Landscape, attributed to Ma Wan (1325-1365), suggests the glory of the natural world with a remote view that allows the viewer to survey the landscape of mountains, trees, and streams.<br />
<br />
This fall at BAM/PFA, you have a wonderful opportunity to see how the rich painting tradition established by these early artists, especially the careful observation of the natural world, continues to inform and inspire with the exhibition Yang Fudong: Estranged Paradise.<br />

"Deities, Demons, and Teachers of Tibet, Nepal, and India, thru Apr 13, 2014",2013-10-16,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67216&date=2013-10-16,"Joyful and sensual sculptural figures of Indian deities and dancers join radiant images of enlightened beings from Tibet and Nepal in Deities, Demons, and Teachers, which presents a rotating display of works by anonymous Indian, Nepalese, and Tibetan artisans. A tenth-century sandstone figure of Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity worshipped by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, graces the entrance to the exhibition, a site appropriate to Ganeshas role in removing obstacles and blessing any new endeavor. Whether viewed as a cosmic dancer or a cavorting adolescent, this image of Ganesha is confirmation of the wonder and delight to be found in the sculpture and painting of these ancient cultures.<br />
<br />
Hindus and Buddhists both revere and celebrate female deities and often depict goddesses in idealized form with exaggerated marks of beauty. In Dancing Devi, a twelfth-century buff-sandstone sculpture from central India, the beauty of the bejeweled and crowned figure is accentuated by the larger-than-life proportions of breasts and buttocks. A more reserved but no less beautifully idealized feminine form is seen in Tara, a seventeenth-century Nepalese bronze, where the figure is surrounded by a fanciful garden of birds, musicians, and garlands.<br />
<br />
Very early images of the Buddha are rare, so it is quite exceptional that in addition to the massive bronze fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddha in the center of the gallery, this exhibition also features a stone image of a third-century seated Buddha from the Swat Valley and a tenth- or eleventh-century bronze Standing Buddha from Western Tibet. An array of bodhisattvas and attendant deities from these regions, including a painting of the Thirteenth Karmapa (at left), believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, fill out the gathered celestial realm of the Buddhist cosmology.<br />

<br />
Yangs work reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation born during and after the Cultural Revolution that is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China. Although he draws much of his subject matter from the consumerist contexts of contemporary urban China, many of his images recall the literati paintings of seventeenth-century China (Yang first trained in painting before switching to photography and filmmaking). His films and film installations have an atemporal and dreamlike quality, marked by long and suspended sequences, dividing narratives, and multiple relationships and storylines. In his recent installations, Yang reflects on the process of filmmaking itself, creating spatially open-ended multichannel films that he calls a contemporary form of the Chinese hand scroll.<br />
<br />
Our presentation of Yangs work includes twenty years of photographs and video and film installations in the galleries; a film series at the PFA Theater co-curated by the artist that focuses on works that have influenced him, ranging from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema of the 1930s and 1940s to the Fifth Generation filmmakers who rose to prominence in the 1980s; and a continuous loop of Yangs single-channel films daily at midday in the Museum Theater. <br />

Bowden followed Hoffmann to New York in 1932 and became a founding member of American Abstract Artists in 1936. Bowden exhibited in New York often in group and solo shows during the 30s, but he left for Sausalito in 1942, where he spent the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Bowdens paintings reflect the prevailing currents of his generation, such as an engagement with the development of modern European masters, as well as an early fascination with abstraction that developed over a decade before he returned to figurative painting. This selection of his paintings is supplemented here by a trove a figure studies in pastel, pencil and gouache that he made c. 1950. A group of photographs provide a window on a lifetime practice that resulted in a series of photographic books, murals, and his work being collected and exhibited by the Museum of Modern Art in 1951. Though Bowden never achieved the renown of some of his peers, his works demonstrate an avid imagination, accomplished technique, and a willingness to experiment in multiple mediums.<br />

<br />
One of the prevailing notions in the nascent field of synthetic biology is that parts, circuits, and systems that have otherwise been optimized by billions of years of evolution are completely fungible. We have developed methods for the facile evolutionary engineering of enzymes, pathways, and organisms, and will show examples of how novel transcription networks, genetic codes, and organismal consortia can be built using directed evolution. That said, directed evolution is just a waystation to rational design, and progress on computational prediction of macromolecular structure and function will be considered as part of the synthetic biology toolset."
"CPT Interpretation of Highly Organic Soils  Practice Innovation, Oct 16",2013-10-16,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70289&date=2013-10-16,"Geosyntecs client is planning to close an existing waste management unit (WMU) at a refinery in Northern California. The WMU contains wastes primarily consisting of oily sludges and impacted soils that were deposited primarily as dredge spoils over a former marsh area. The waste is underlain by 0 to 50 feet of highly organic soils with water contents between 300% and 600%, and 0 to 15 feet of organic young bay mud with water contents between 80% and 200%. The water table at the site is 2 to 5 feet below the surface of the unit.<br />
<br />
One of the many closure options being evaluated is a California Title 27 soil cover to be constructed above the unit. Key geotechnical concerns with this option include low bearing capacity of soils impacting constructability, low stability safety factors at the edges of the cover, and large differential settlement potential across the cover footprint. To evaluate these potential impacts, the first step was to differentiate between the highly organic soils and the organic young bay muds. <br />

Young bay muds and highly organic soils encountered at the site tend to resemble nearly identical materials in CPT (cone penetration test) soundings using a standard 20-ton cone. For this investigation, a 5-ton cone (calibration for lower loads and higher sensitivity) was utilized in order to test for smaller differences in tip resistance and sleeve friction. The field investigation program culminated in 31 CPTs advanced with 8 mud rotary borings performed adjacent to selected CPTs to calibrate the results for stratigraphy and obtain samples for laboratory testing. Using CPT resistance, visual observations, and laboratory results at the 8 CPT/boring pairs, Geosyntec was able to develop a methodology that could be extrapolated to all 31 CPTs to evaluate the stratigraphy at the site and develop properties for use in analysis."

<br />
Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures David Fricks body of research addresses questions of rhetoric, philology, religion, culture, and society in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth of the early modern period. His latest publication, Kith, Kin, & Neighbors: Communities and Confessions in Seventeenth-Century Wilno (Cornell, 2013), examines how seventeenth-century inhabitants of the Commonwealth navigated cultural and religious differences.<br />
<br />
In the mid-seventeenth century, Wilno (Vilnius), the second capital of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was home to Poles, Lithuanians, Germans, Ruthenians, Jews, and Tatars; they worshiped in Catholic, Uniate, Orthodox, Calvinist, and Lutheran churches, one synagogue, and one mosque. Visitors regularly commented on the relatively peaceful coexistence of this bewildering array of peoples, languages, and faiths. In Kith, Kin, & Neighbors, Professor Frick shows how Wilno's inhabitants negotiated these differences in their public and private lives, while also setting a new standard for urban history and for work on the religious and communal life of Eastern Europe.<br />
<br />
After an introduction by Thomas Brady (History), Professor Frick will speak briefly about his work, read a short excerpt, and then open the floor for discussion."

Secondly, philanthropic and public policymakers demand evidence of the effectiveness of educational interventions. These dynamics have invigorated an already vibrant sector of intermediary organizations that seek to package and promote research on education policies and programs for policymakers, typically around a specific policy agenda. Educational reforms that promise to incentivize school improvement are of particular interest to intermediaries. This presentation examines how these intermediary organizations shape research and its use through their efforts at funding, interpreting, and dissemination around incentivist reforms like charter schools, teacher compensation incentives, and student pay-for-performance.<br />

Specifically, we estimate the relative roles of knowledge spillovers versus recruiting externalities as they affect co-located researchers who are related or unrelated to the star in idea space. Hiring a star does not increase overall incumbent productivity, but this aggregate effect hides offsetting effects on colleagues who are related (positive) versus unrelated (negative). Star hires improve subsequent joiner quality for both related and unrelated scientists, although the effect is significantly larger for related scientists. The overall positive impact of the star on department-level productivity is mainly due to joiner-quality effects. Furthermore, the productivity impact is more pronounced at mid- and lower-ranked institutions, suggesting implications for the optimal spatial organization of science and university strategies aimed at ascending departmental rankings."

It is large enough to include many standard parametric families and yet it retains many of the desirable properties of Gaussian densities, e.g. closure under marginalisation, conditioning and convolution operations. Importantly, the class is also small enough to allow fully automatic estimation procedures, e.g. using maximum likelihood, where more traditional nonparametric methods would require troublesome choices of smoothing parameters. I will begin by describing the log-concave density estimation problem, including recent theoretical results. I will also show how related ideas of log-concave projections are relevant for other inferential problems including regression, testing and Independent Component Analysis."

"How the Method of Frobenius Led to Self-Replicating 3D Zombie Vortices in Turbulent Lab Flows and the Formation of Stars, Oct 16",2013-10-16,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=71387&date=2013-10-16,"We report a new mechanism for creating vortices in a class of flows that are linearly stable and believed, by most researchers, to be also finite-amplitude stable. We find that the vortices form in numerical simulations of stably-stratified Couette flows (both plane and circular), as well as in simulations of protoplanetary disks around forming protostars. Our study was motivated by the fact that protoplanetary disks must have flow instabilities to form stars. The mechanism that we discovered allows small-amplitude perturbations (i.e\., with small volumes and Rossby numbers) to form vortices that are large in volume and amplitude (with a Rossby number of order unity). The energy of the vortices becomes large, and it is supplied the kinetic energy of the background shear flow. The underlying mathematics of the finite-amplitude instability lies in Math 53 and 54. Our vortices have an unusual property: a vortex that grows from a single, local perturbation triggers a new generation of vortices to grow at nearby locations. After the second generation of vortices grows large, it triggers a third generation. The triggering of subsequent generations continues ad infinitum so that a front dividing the vortex-dominated flow from the unperturbed flow advances until the entire domain fills with large vortices. The vortices do not advect across the region, the front of the vortex-populated fluid does. The region in protoplanetary disks where we have found this new mechanism is thought to be stable; thus, in the astrophysical literature this region is called the dead zone. Because the vortices we report here arise in the dead zone, grow large, and spawn new generations of vortices that march across the domain, we refer to them as zombie vortices. We consider the mechanism of the zombie vortices growth and advance in a proposed lab experiment: circular Couette flow with a vertically stably-stratified Boussinesq fluid (i.e., salt water) with a density that is linear with height. Because this flow is nearly homogenous, the first vortex formed by the initial instability self-replicates in an approximately spatially self-similar manner and fills the domain with a lattice of 3D vortices, which persists, despite the fact that the flow is turbulent."

These measurements probe both the physics of the very early universe and the basic properties of the universe today. The Planck measurements confirm the earlier results from the WMAP telescope and rigorously test our standard cosmological model and provide an accurate determination of basic cosmological parameters (the shape of the universe, its age, and its composition). When combined with other astronomical measurements, the measurements constrain the properties of the dark energy and the nature of dark matter. The observations also directly probe the physics of first moments of the Big Bang: the current data are consistent with the idea that the early universe underwent a period of rapid expansion called inflation.<br />
<br />
Many key cosmological questions remain unanswered: What happened during the first moments of the big bang? What is the dark energy? What were the properties of the first stars? In this free public lecture, Dr. Spergel will discuss the role of ongoing and future CMB observations and describe how the combination of large-scale structure, supernova and CMB data can be used to address these key cosmological questions."

Film Meets Vision, Rejoice! Manohla Dargis, New York Times<br />
Phil Solomon is an alchemist and archeologist of cinema. His complex optical treatments of found and original footage create mesmerizing degraded images that shimmer and shatter, revealing their hidden poetry. Meditations on loss, decay, and memory, his 16mm films are unsettling yet unforgettable. More recently, Solomon has worked digitally to create haunting, evocative landscapes. In the trilogy In Memoriam, he draws on the video game series grand Theft Auto to conjure an existential tale of solemn beauty. In his most recent Psalm, the moody Valley of the Shadow, John Huston reads Joyces The Dead. San Francisco Cinematheque hosts Solomon on Saturday, October 19 when he presents his three-screen triptych American Falls at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.

As such, we seek a very wide array of submissions from all disciplines. We encourage scholars to think deeply about what we should study and to distill crisp research questions, such that we can collectively put forth an effective and coherent research agenda. While the focus will be equity crowdfunding, we will consider research on all versions of the phenomenon. If you have any preliminary research results to share, they would be appreciated, however, we also welcome thoughtful expositions and research designs.<br />

This ambitious five-venue exhibition and its accompanying programs will provide San Franciscans and Bay Area residents with an opportunity to confront visions for the region that never came to be.<br />
<br />
Each institution will display treasures from archival collections, architecture firms and private collections, and host companion programming. Unbuilt San Francisco at the College of Environmental Design is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers a shadow city and phantom skyline. The curators explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. The exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area."
"Holy Land, California, thru Dec 13",2013-10-17,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69005&date=2013-10-17,"In 1974, the Judah L. Magnes Museum commissioned Albert Garvey (Chicago, 1932), a photographer, printmaker, and graphic designer then based in Fairfax, California, to create a portfolio of views of contemporary Israel. This commission, unconventional for its time, resulted in the work, We Are the Wall Itself, a collection of twenty-four even more unconventional serigraphs (color silkscreen prints), based on images taken by the artist and his wife, Barbara, first in 1960 and again in the spring of 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War.<br />
<br />
Starting from over one thousand 35mm. photographs, altered in the darkroom and combined with hand-drawn stencils, Garvey depicted religious gatherings, the walls and the streets of Jerusalem, the urbanization of Eilat, agricultural work in the kibbutz, and the emerging youth counterculture.<br />
<br />
By presenting a selection from the original project, we are revisiting two sets of cultural conventions: those connected to the artistic practice of imaging the Holy Land, as well as the ways in which the State of Israel has commonly been portrayed since its founding in 1948. Emblematic of the unique view of modern Israel that emerged out of California in the 1960s and early 1970s, Garveys eye seized Israels diversity through the lenses of a then popular form of Pop Art (screen printing), distant from the tropes that had until then marked its representation in America and elsewhere. Rather than glorifying military might, agricultural advancements, and archeological treasures, these images offer a direct appreciation for the daily life of a developing country in which multiple cultures continually negotiated their forms of coexistence.<br />

The exhibition includes over one hundred individual items, many of which were never catalogued before.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a dynamic collecting campaign conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, The Magnes became one of the world's most extensive repositories of materials about the Jews of Southern India, along with the historic sites in Kerala and national and private collections in Israel, where most of the Kerala Jews settled after the founding of the State in 1948.<br />
<br />
The collection includes hundreds of ritual objects, textiles, photographs, archival records, Hebrew books, and manuscripts, including liturgical texts, illustrated ketubbot (Jewish marriage contracts) and amulets, in Hebrew, Aramaic, Malayalam, Judeo-Spanish, and English.<br />
<br />
These materials constitute an invaluable source of information on the Kerala Jewish community, one of the oldest in the world, and its deep connections with Indias society and cultures and with the global Jewish Diaspora, across India, the Middle East, and Europe. Among the most notable items on display are the Torah Ark from the Tekkumbhagam synagogue in Mattancherry, Kochi, and an extremely rare amulet on parchment, designed to protect women in childbirth and newborn children.<br />
<br />
This exhibition is the culmination of years of curatorial work devoted to assessing and documenting the holdings of The Magnes Collection, conducted in collaboration with experts in Israel and the US. It also inaugurates a new season of research, engaging the scholarly community at UC Berkeley and beyond, and intersecting Jewish and Asian Studies.<br />

Dallas was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up surrounded by great music, the famous Kansas City blues and jazz. Music had a profound effect on him as a young man, but he discovered his true talent in painting after his move to Berkeley, California in 1963. He earned a BFA from UC Berkeley in 1974.<br />
<br />
Currently living and painting in Oakland, Dallas is a versatile painter who incorporates calligraphy, figure studies and abstract painting into his work. A traveler whenever possible, Dallas has visited more than 25 countries. During his travels to Japan he studied calligraphy, woodblock printing, handmade paper and Sumi ink brush painting with master artist Toshi Yoshida. Yet, music remains an important part of his practice and he paints almost exclusively while listening to jazz. His two-handed, brushless style of painting is unique; he calls his style artmatism. The divine principle of true artmatism painting is to be in a constant state of enlightenment, states Dallas. Freedom first, then comes enlightenment, and with that enlightenment you understand division and separation of the imaginations. <br />
<br />
Dallas has exhibited throughout the Bay Area and the United States. His work is found in private collections throughout the world, including Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. He was recently included in The Kinsey Collection: Shared Treasures of Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, an exhibition at San Franciscos Museum of the African Diaspora."

"Gazing into Nature, thru Oct 20",2013-10-17,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67215&date=2013-10-17,"We are delighted to present, for the first time in ten years, a selection of BAM/PFAs earliest Chinese paintings. These rare and amazingly well-preserved works by early landscape and bird-and-flower painters of the late Song and early Yuan periods (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), rendered on silk or paper with ink and light color, demonstrate the sophistication and accomplishment of the early Chinese painting tradition.<br />
<br />
Early Chinese painters often depicted the natural world through a lens of gentle mists created by delicate brushwork. Whether capturing a refined corner of the universe, as in Ma Yuans thirteenth-century Plum Tree and Ducks by a Stream, or a single twisted branch of a grapevine, as in Wen Riguans thirteenth-century Grapes, it is the artists control of ink, wash, and line that brings the subject to life. Equally compelling is the anonymous Fish and Water Plants from the fifteenth century, which depicts a powerful carp rising through a bed of delicately rendered vegetation; the very light touches of color in this work add a pleasing naturalism to the scene.<br />
<br />
Landscape painters, too, conveyed the beauty and grandeur of the natural world. Their interpretations were not intended to be of specific places rendered in realistic terms, but rather idealized landscapes of retreat and reclusion. The tall trees of Guo Mins Fir and Pines in the Snow (thirteenth century) form a protective circle around a figure pictured in a hut at the base of a fantastic and turbulent mountain. The artist concedes that man is but a small part of a much grander universe. Similarly, River Landscape, attributed to Ma Wan (1325-1365), suggests the glory of the natural world with a remote view that allows the viewer to survey the landscape of mountains, trees, and streams.<br />
<br />
This fall at BAM/PFA, you have a wonderful opportunity to see how the rich painting tradition established by these early artists, especially the careful observation of the natural world, continues to inform and inspire with the exhibition Yang Fudong: Estranged Paradise.<br />

"Deities, Demons, and Teachers of Tibet, Nepal, and India, thru Apr 13, 2014",2013-10-17,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67216&date=2013-10-17,"Joyful and sensual sculptural figures of Indian deities and dancers join radiant images of enlightened beings from Tibet and Nepal in Deities, Demons, and Teachers, which presents a rotating display of works by anonymous Indian, Nepalese, and Tibetan artisans. A tenth-century sandstone figure of Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity worshipped by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, graces the entrance to the exhibition, a site appropriate to Ganeshas role in removing obstacles and blessing any new endeavor. Whether viewed as a cosmic dancer or a cavorting adolescent, this image of Ganesha is confirmation of the wonder and delight to be found in the sculpture and painting of these ancient cultures.<br />
<br />
Hindus and Buddhists both revere and celebrate female deities and often depict goddesses in idealized form with exaggerated marks of beauty. In Dancing Devi, a twelfth-century buff-sandstone sculpture from central India, the beauty of the bejeweled and crowned figure is accentuated by the larger-than-life proportions of breasts and buttocks. A more reserved but no less beautifully idealized feminine form is seen in Tara, a seventeenth-century Nepalese bronze, where the figure is surrounded by a fanciful garden of birds, musicians, and garlands.<br />
<br />
Very early images of the Buddha are rare, so it is quite exceptional that in addition to the massive bronze fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddha in the center of the gallery, this exhibition also features a stone image of a third-century seated Buddha from the Swat Valley and a tenth- or eleventh-century bronze Standing Buddha from Western Tibet. An array of bodhisattvas and attendant deities from these regions, including a painting of the Thirteenth Karmapa (at left), believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, fill out the gathered celestial realm of the Buddhist cosmology.<br />

<br />
Yangs work reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation born during and after the Cultural Revolution that is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China. Although he draws much of his subject matter from the consumerist contexts of contemporary urban China, many of his images recall the literati paintings of seventeenth-century China (Yang first trained in painting before switching to photography and filmmaking). His films and film installations have an atemporal and dreamlike quality, marked by long and suspended sequences, dividing narratives, and multiple relationships and storylines. In his recent installations, Yang reflects on the process of filmmaking itself, creating spatially open-ended multichannel films that he calls a contemporary form of the Chinese hand scroll.<br />
<br />
Our presentation of Yangs work includes twenty years of photographs and video and film installations in the galleries; a film series at the PFA Theater co-curated by the artist that focuses on works that have influenced him, ranging from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema of the 1930s and 1940s to the Fifth Generation filmmakers who rose to prominence in the 1980s; and a continuous loop of Yangs single-channel films daily at midday in the Museum Theater. <br />

Most of them are related to the theory of optimal transportation, which is the theme of one of the two MSRI programs this fall: see http://www.msri.org/programs/277.<br />
<br />
1) Fully nonlinear elliptic equations: The canonical example is the reduction of the Monge-Amp`ere equation (a fully nonlinear elliptic PDE related to the Minkowski problem in geometry) to a convex minimization problem, `a la Kantorovich, which can be solved by convex duality techniques. Connections with combinatorial optimization and optimal transport will be discussed.<br />
<br />
2) Mathematical fluid mechanics:<br />
i) Some solutions to the Euler equations can be obtained by using the least action principle (following V.I. Arnolds geometric interpretation), leading to the problem of optimal incompressible transport; this problem has a hidden convex structure which provides existence, uniqueness and partial regularity for its solution.<br />
ii) The hydrostatic and semi-geostrophic limits of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are examples of very singular limits that cannot be justified on standard linear functional spaces but can be addressed successfully on suitable convex functional cones.<br />
<br />
3) Electromagnetism and magnetohydrodynamics:<br />
i) The nonlinear theory of electromagnetism by Born and Infeld is described by a system of nonlinear conservation laws (which leads to the standard Maxwell equations for fields of low intensity), which has an interesting hidden structure, showing very easily its hyperbolic nature; the high field limit of the BI equations will be discussed and related to the optimal transport of currents.<br />
ii) The magnetic relaxation equations proposed by Moffatt can be seen as a natural extension to divergence-free vector fields of the scalar heat equation (following the interpretation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto); they form a very degenerate parabolic systems of PDEs with a hidden convex structure that enables us to show the global existence of dissipative solutions (in the spirit of P.-L. Lions and Ambrosio-Gigli-Savare)."

Bowden followed Hoffmann to New York in 1932 and became a founding member of American Abstract Artists in 1936. Bowden exhibited in New York often in group and solo shows during the 30s, but he left for Sausalito in 1942, where he spent the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Bowdens paintings reflect the prevailing currents of his generation, such as an engagement with the development of modern European masters, as well as an early fascination with abstraction that developed over a decade before he returned to figurative painting. This selection of his paintings is supplemented here by a trove a figure studies in pastel, pencil and gouache that he made c. 1950. A group of photographs provide a window on a lifetime practice that resulted in a series of photographic books, murals, and his work being collected and exhibited by the Museum of Modern Art in 1951. Though Bowden never achieved the renown of some of his peers, his works demonstrate an avid imagination, accomplished technique, and a willingness to experiment in multiple mediums.<br />

The goal of my ethnographic study was to approximate an experimental design and isolate the effects of social policies and national culture. First, I find that not only do the content of policies matter, but also how they are implemented. Sluggish, bureaucratic, and antagonistic institutions of government, unions, and corporations failed workers in both countries, providing little except band-aids for their intractable labor-market problems. Second, I argue that a meritocratic ideology of individualism is becoming more influential even among unionized blue-collar workers, contrary to past work. The political and economic climate has changed in ways that are reshaping worker attitudes, I contendespecially in the institutionally weaker US."

At the turn of the millennium, representatives of these institutions adopted liquid nitrogen-based cryopreservation systems to support repositories of frozen blood, sperm and eggs. Broad anxieties about endangerment of biodiversity found expression in efforts to preserve these bits of animal bodies for the future. I explain the consequence of these efforts in terms of ""planned hindsight"" -- an orientation to the future that attempts to prepare for the need to look back to the past -- in three separate biodiversity cryopreservation projects. If cryopreservation has served as a technology for harnessing a slice of life in a state of suspended animation, planned hindsight has provided the ethical and epistemological justification for how that slice should be made."

I depart from existing approaches that treat race as an axis of identity. Instead, I argue for the necessity of treating race as a set of ideas about black people. Interviews and ethnographic observations reveal that strong expressions of racial identity are common among African-American Republicans. However, there are very different ideas about who constitutes the group being identified with. Divergent ideas about black people divide African-American Republicans. These ideas impact 3 aspects of their political behavior: (1) interpretation of conservative social policy, (2) their ability to organize themselves, and (3) their capacity to build alliances with white Republicans. To fully understand black political behavior, analysts must move from only considering race as a marker of identity for black people, to also thinking about race as a set of ideas black people have about black people."

By designing polymerizable LLCs with different tailored shapes and functional properties, cross-linked nanoporous polymer materials with different ordered geometries can be generated via in situ radical photopolymerization. These LLC polymer networks have the ability to perform different types of chemistry and molecular transport in the solvent-filled pores. This talk will present an overview of our work with respect to designing, developing, and demonstrating cross-linked LLC assemblies as a new class of functional polymer material for engineering applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, molecular-size separations, and enhanced ion transport. Some new directions for cross-linked LLC materials design in my group will also be presented."

We will discuss discrete isoperimetric inequalities, the notion of influence, threshold phenomena for stochastic models, and the noise-sensitivity / noise-stability dichotomy. I will also mention how some of these studied originated in computer science, or are applied to computer science, and if time allows also some connections with social choice theory."
"Everyday Empire in Dubai: Urban and Spatial Effects of the Long Imperial Encounter, Oct 17",2013-10-17,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67794&date=2013-10-17,"While the Arab Gulfs imperial geography has been recognized at the level of geopolitics, little if any work has connected empire to the daily, human geographies of the region. Scholarship on the intersection between urbanism and empire has tended to emphasize issues of surveillance and governance, assuming, whether intentionally or not, an imperial, birds-eye point of view. Such an approach both leaves much interesting material out of the analytical frame and privileges so-called central or major imperial cities. In his talk, Prof. Kanna proposes another frame for imperial urbanism, taking as his case study the city of Dubai, and specifically its spaces of bourgeois gratification -- British pubs, gated communities, shopping malls, and resorts. These, Prof. Kanna argues, demonstrate that the city has been as profoundly shaped by its imperial legacy as have more recognizable imperial cities. Dubai has long been a place where British and other Western expatriates can escape the stresses and constraints of life in the West; this phenomenon is as much a product of the imperial encounter as are more recognizable products of empire."

Smihi pays tribute to the art of storytellingand the grace of lifein this collection of four tales, four cities, and multiple realities. In the old city of Fez, a young boy tries and fails to escape circumcision, and afterwards his mother comforts him with three tales. In one, set amidst the wild performers and chaotic markets of Marrakesh, a group of young boys torment a monkey-handler, until one day the tables (or the chains) are reversed. In Essaouira, in Orson Welles Square, a man searches for his lover, but cannot find her in a sea of veils. Finally, in Tangier, a fisherman searches for the fortune he believes is in a whale, but a more modern beast may be his final fate. A 1001 Nights updated with pointed interrogations of masculinity, tradition, immigration, and colonization, Moroccan Chronicles pays tribute to oral storytellers, and how their tales reflect cultural and political realities.<br />

This ambitious five-venue exhibition and its accompanying programs will provide San Franciscans and Bay Area residents with an opportunity to confront visions for the region that never came to be.<br />
<br />
Each institution will display treasures from archival collections, architecture firms and private collections, and host companion programming. Unbuilt San Francisco at the College of Environmental Design is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers a shadow city and phantom skyline. The curators explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. The exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area."
"Holy Land, California, thru Dec 13",2013-10-18,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69005&date=2013-10-18,"In 1974, the Judah L. Magnes Museum commissioned Albert Garvey (Chicago, 1932), a photographer, printmaker, and graphic designer then based in Fairfax, California, to create a portfolio of views of contemporary Israel. This commission, unconventional for its time, resulted in the work, We Are the Wall Itself, a collection of twenty-four even more unconventional serigraphs (color silkscreen prints), based on images taken by the artist and his wife, Barbara, first in 1960 and again in the spring of 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War.<br />
<br />
Starting from over one thousand 35mm. photographs, altered in the darkroom and combined with hand-drawn stencils, Garvey depicted religious gatherings, the walls and the streets of Jerusalem, the urbanization of Eilat, agricultural work in the kibbutz, and the emerging youth counterculture.<br />
<br />
By presenting a selection from the original project, we are revisiting two sets of cultural conventions: those connected to the artistic practice of imaging the Holy Land, as well as the ways in which the State of Israel has commonly been portrayed since its founding in 1948. Emblematic of the unique view of modern Israel that emerged out of California in the 1960s and early 1970s, Garveys eye seized Israels diversity through the lenses of a then popular form of Pop Art (screen printing), distant from the tropes that had until then marked its representation in America and elsewhere. Rather than glorifying military might, agricultural advancements, and archeological treasures, these images offer a direct appreciation for the daily life of a developing country in which multiple cultures continually negotiated their forms of coexistence.<br />

The exhibition includes over one hundred individual items, many of which were never catalogued before.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a dynamic collecting campaign conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, The Magnes became one of the world's most extensive repositories of materials about the Jews of Southern India, along with the historic sites in Kerala and national and private collections in Israel, where most of the Kerala Jews settled after the founding of the State in 1948.<br />
<br />
The collection includes hundreds of ritual objects, textiles, photographs, archival records, Hebrew books, and manuscripts, including liturgical texts, illustrated ketubbot (Jewish marriage contracts) and amulets, in Hebrew, Aramaic, Malayalam, Judeo-Spanish, and English.<br />
<br />
These materials constitute an invaluable source of information on the Kerala Jewish community, one of the oldest in the world, and its deep connections with Indias society and cultures and with the global Jewish Diaspora, across India, the Middle East, and Europe. Among the most notable items on display are the Torah Ark from the Tekkumbhagam synagogue in Mattancherry, Kochi, and an extremely rare amulet on parchment, designed to protect women in childbirth and newborn children.<br />
<br />
This exhibition is the culmination of years of curatorial work devoted to assessing and documenting the holdings of The Magnes Collection, conducted in collaboration with experts in Israel and the US.

A traveler whenever possible, Dallas has visited more than 25 countries. During his travels to Japan he studied calligraphy, woodblock printing, handmade paper and Sumi ink brush painting with master artist Toshi Yoshida. Yet, music remains an important part of his practice and he paints almost exclusively while listening to jazz. His two-handed, brushless style of painting is unique; he calls his style artmatism. The divine principle of true artmatism painting is to be in a constant state of enlightenment, states Dallas. Freedom first, then comes enlightenment, and with that enlightenment you understand division and separation of the imaginations. <br />
<br />
Dallas has exhibited throughout the Bay Area and the United States. His work is found in private collections throughout the world, including Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. He was recently included in The Kinsey Collection: Shared Treasures of Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, an exhibition at San Franciscos Museum of the African Diaspora."

The stories behind these photographs tell of hope, ambition, greed, resistance, and visions that have been crushed or cast aside. Some stories are of gleaming structures hauntingly unpeopled; some stories are of teeming populations surviving amid the squalor of urban ruins. With the frenzy of Chinas economic growth has come accelerated decay, leaving city and country alike scarred by the relics of past dreams."

That's the moment being explored from a variety of perspectives in Unbuilt San Francisco: Ambition and Imagination. <br />
<br />
At its most basic, the exhibition is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers the shadow city and phantom skyline that never came to be, for better and for worse. In the process, we explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. <br />
<br />
Co-curated by design critic John King and EDA Curator Waverly Lowell, the exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago."

These rare and amazingly well-preserved works by early landscape and bird-and-flower painters of the late Song and early Yuan periods (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), rendered on silk or paper with ink and light color, demonstrate the sophistication and accomplishment of the early Chinese painting tradition.<br />
<br />
Early Chinese painters often depicted the natural world through a lens of gentle mists created by delicate brushwork. Whether capturing a refined corner of the universe, as in Ma Yuans thirteenth-century Plum Tree and Ducks by a Stream, or a single twisted branch of a grapevine, as in Wen Riguans thirteenth-century Grapes, it is the artists control of ink, wash, and line that brings the subject to life. Equally compelling is the anonymous Fish and Water Plants from the fifteenth century, which depicts a powerful carp rising through a bed of delicately rendered vegetation; the very light touches of color in this work add a pleasing naturalism to the scene.<br />
<br />
Landscape painters, too, conveyed the beauty and grandeur of the natural world. Their interpretations were not intended to be of specific places rendered in realistic terms, but rather idealized landscapes of retreat and reclusion. The tall trees of Guo Mins Fir and Pines in the Snow (thirteenth century) form a protective circle around a figure pictured in a hut at the base of a fantastic and turbulent mountain. The artist concedes that man is but a small part of a much grander universe. Similarly, River Landscape, attributed to Ma Wan (1325-1365), suggests the glory of the natural world with a remote view that allows the viewer to survey the landscape of mountains, trees, and streams.<br />
<br />
This fall at BAM/PFA, you have a wonderful opportunity to see how the rich painting tradition established by these early artists, especially the careful observation of the natural world, continues to inform and inspire with the exhibition Yang Fudong: Estranged Paradise.<br />

A tenth-century sandstone figure of Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity worshipped by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, graces the entrance to the exhibition, a site appropriate to Ganeshas role in removing obstacles and blessing any new endeavor. Whether viewed as a cosmic dancer or a cavorting adolescent, this image of Ganesha is confirmation of the wonder and delight to be found in the sculpture and painting of these ancient cultures.<br />
<br />
Hindus and Buddhists both revere and celebrate female deities and often depict goddesses in idealized form with exaggerated marks of beauty. In Dancing Devi, a twelfth-century buff-sandstone sculpture from central India, the beauty of the bejeweled and crowned figure is accentuated by the larger-than-life proportions of breasts and buttocks. A more reserved but no less beautifully idealized feminine form is seen in Tara, a seventeenth-century Nepalese bronze, where the figure is surrounded by a fanciful garden of birds, musicians, and garlands.<br />
<br />
Very early images of the Buddha are rare, so it is quite exceptional that in addition to the massive bronze fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddha in the center of the gallery, this exhibition also features a stone image of a third-century seated Buddha from the Swat Valley and a tenth- or eleventh-century bronze Standing Buddha from Western Tibet. An array of bodhisattvas and attendant deities from these regions, including a painting of the Thirteenth Karmapa (at left), believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, fill out the gathered celestial realm of the Buddhist cosmology.<br />

This presentation showcases approximately fifteen paintings made by the artist over the last two decades, highlighting her more recent series of adornment and branded paintings, which conflate the surface textures of the painting with various aspects of the female body, primarily flesh. The artist drips and meticulously builds layers of thick oil paint in her modestly scaled works, the largest of which measure three feet square and the smallest seven inches square. She engages with the physical aspects of paint, repeatedly turning the canvas on its side to build up a dense network of layers, which sometimes appear more sculptural than painterly.<br />

The female body, shown in abstracted close-ups, has been a particular focus of her oeuvre, as witnessed in diverse representations of female genitalia and other fragmented body parts (belly buttons, hair, nipples, tattoos, etc.).

<br />
Yangs work reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation born during and after the Cultural Revolution that is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China. Although he draws much of his subject matter from the consumerist contexts of contemporary urban China, many of his images recall the literati paintings of seventeenth-century China (Yang first trained in painting before switching to photography and filmmaking). His films and film installations have an atemporal and dreamlike quality, marked by long and suspended sequences, dividing narratives, and multiple relationships and storylines. In his recent installations, Yang reflects on the process of filmmaking itself, creating spatially open-ended multichannel films that he calls a contemporary form of the Chinese hand scroll.<br />
<br />
Our presentation of Yangs work includes twenty years of photographs and video and film installations in the galleries; a film series at the PFA Theater co-curated by the artist that focuses on works that have influenced him, ranging from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema of the 1930s and 1940s to the Fifth Generation filmmakers who rose to prominence in the 1980s; and a continuous loop of Yangs single-channel films daily at midday in the Museum Theater. <br />

This idea only becomes more than a loose analogy, though, if there is a theory of communication that can add something substantial to our understanding of memory. I'll argue that recent models of communication, developed for quite different applications, can indeed play this role. Application of these ideas to memory can inform debates about the 'reconstructive' nature of memory, the function of episodic memory, and the relations between memory in genetic, epigenetic, and neural systems."

Bowden followed Hoffmann to New York in 1932 and became a founding member of American Abstract Artists in 1936. Bowden exhibited in New York often in group and solo shows during the 30s, but he left for Sausalito in 1942, where he spent the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Bowdens paintings reflect the prevailing currents of his generation, such as an engagement with the development of modern European masters, as well as an early fascination with abstraction that developed over a decade before he returned to figurative painting. This selection of his paintings is supplemented here by a trove a figure studies in pastel, pencil and gouache that he made c. 1950. A group of photographs provide a window on a lifetime practice that resulted in a series of photographic books, murals, and his work being collected and exhibited by the Museum of Modern Art in 1951. Though Bowden never achieved the renown of some of his peers, his works demonstrate an avid imagination, accomplished technique, and a willingness to experiment in multiple mediums.<br />

In it, she asks you to disengage from some of your most cherished notions of love: that it is exclusive, lasting, and unconditional. In synthesizing behavioral, psychophysiological, and neural data from multiple laboratories, Fredrickson reveals how love  defined as micro-moments in which positivity resonates between and among people  can build enduring resources, such as wisdom, community, and even physical health. Making the case that love creates physical health, Fredrickson describes results from recent randomized controlled trials from her PEP Lab, in which people learn how to self-generate feelings of love and compassion. She and her team find that cardiac vagal tone forecasts peoples day-to-day experiences of love, and that by learning to self-generate love more frequently, people can further improve their vagal tone, and with it, their mental and physical health. This upward spiral dynamic explains how fleeting experiences of positive connection can accumulate and compound to set people on trajectories toward health. More generally, Fredricksons fresh take on love offers practical approaches to strengthening your relationships, teams, and communities."

Unfortunately, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are subject to substantial inherent imperfections that pose major obstacles to the design of robust and very large-scale CNFET digital systems:<br />
<br />
 It is nearly impossible to guarantee perfect alignment and positioning of all CNTs. This limitation introduces stray conducting paths, resulting in incorrect circuit functionality.<br />
<br />
 CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting depending on chirality. Metallic CNTs cause shorts resulting in excessive leakage and incorrect circuit functionality.<br />
<br />
A combination of design and processing technique overcomes these challenges by creating robust CNFET digital circuits that are immune to these inherent imperfections. This imperfection-immune design paradigm enables the first experimental demonstration of the carbon<br />
nanotube computer, and, more generally, arbitrary digital systems that can be built using CNFETs. Demonstration of monolithically integrated three-dimensional CNFET circuits will also be discussed.<br />

This research was performed at Stanford University in collaboration with Prof. H.-S. Philip Wong and several Ph.D. students."

<br />
Since the use of carbon-containing fuels is entrenched in society, controlling the atmospheric CO2 concentration may ultimately require recycling CO2 into liquid fuels and commodity chemicals using renewable energy as the power source. Arguably the greatest challenge for this vision is to develop efficient CO2 reduction catalysts. <br />
<br />
This talk will describe our development of oxide-derived metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts. Oxide-derived metal nanoparticles are prepared by electrochemically reducing metal oxide precursors, which results in highly strained nanocrystals. <br />
<br />
I will describe examples of these catalysts that electrochemically reduce CO2 to CO with exceptional energetic efficiency as well as a catalyst that selectively reduces CO to two-carbon oxygenates. The catalysts operate in water at ambient temperature and pressure and are remarkably robust. The reduction mechanisms will be discussed based on electrokinetic measurements. Metal oxide reduction represents a top-down approach to metal nanoparticle synthesis that produces unique surface structures for catalysis."

Since the use of carbon-containing fuels is entrenched in society, controlling the atmospheric CO2 concentration may ultimately require recycling CO2 into liquid fuels and commodity chemicals using renewable energy as the power source. Arguably the greatest challenge for this vision is to develop efficient CO2 reduction catalysts. <br />
<br />
This talk will describe our development of oxide-derived metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts. Oxide-derived metal nanoparticles are prepared by electrochemically reducing metal oxide precursors, which results in highly strained nanocrystals. <br />
<br />
I will describe examples of these catalysts that electrochemically reduce CO2 to CO with exceptional energetic efficiency as well as a catalyst that selectively reduces CO to two-carbon oxygenates. The catalysts operate in water at ambient temperature and pressure and are remarkably robust. The reduction mechanisms will be discussed based on electrokinetic measurements. Metal oxide reduction represents a top-down approach to metal nanoparticle synthesis that produces unique surface structures for catalysis."

""The US Rebalance to Asia and the South China Sea Dispute""<br />
<br />
The United States calls itself a resident Pacific power. US President Barack Obama has in recent years reinvigorated American strategic influence in the region through a pivot or rebalance to Asia. This talk assesses how and the extent to which the US rebalancing has impacted the South China Sea disputes. The South China Sea is at the center of competing territorial, economic, and strategic interests. The issue is complicated by the number of disputants. While the claimants to the Paracel Islands are the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam, six states assert ownership over the Spratly Islands and/or their surrounding waters, namely, Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The presentation first examines the origins and main characteristics of the US rebalancing to Asia before describing the traditional American position on the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. It argues that the United States has not taken sides in the disputes and has restricted its interest to the preservation of the freedom of navigation. It then discusses whether and to what extent Washington has changed its position in recent years in response to renewed Chinese assertiveness in the disputed waters. It also reviews regional responses to the US involvement and concludes by assessing its impact on the peaceful management of the South China Sea disputes.<br />

""Chinas Marine Policy on Asserting Sovereignty over Islands in East and South China Seas: Legal and Political Perspectives""<br />
<br />
Observing from the heated developments over the Diaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea with Japan and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea with the Philippines and Vietnam, it is a common criticism what China has done in enhancing its maritime claims is through coercion and intimidation towards its neighbours. Is it really so? Also, what kind of policy tools that China operates to express its determination in maintaining sovereignty over those islands? <br />

""The Philippines Arbitral Proceedings Against China on the South China Sea Disputes: Latest Developments and Legal Implications""<br />
<br />
Sabre-rattling and confrontations at sea. Claim and counter-claim. Protest and counter-protest. Undoubtedly, the South China Sea has been the stage of one of the most complex international disputes in recent years. The sovereignty dispute between multiple state actors over small offshore features in the South China Sea and the accompanying claims to maritime resources surrounding such features have long been a flashpoint for tension in the region. The technical and legal questions are complicated enough but coupled with the competing threads of nationalism, history and big power geopolitics that are inherent in the South China Sea disputes, a long-term solution does not appear to be in sight. <br />
<br />
In 2012, in an unprecedented move that took the international community by surprise, the Philippines initiated arbitral proceedings against China under Annex VII of UNCLOS over the latters claims in the South China Sea, including the validity of Chinas u-shaped line. Opinion is divided on whether the Philippines course of action will move the disputes towards a peaceful resolution or whether it will exacerbate an already precarious situation. In this regard, the Seminar will give an overview of the Philippines-China arbitral proceedings and will outline the latest developments. It will then explore possible outcomes of the arbitral proceedings and discuss the legal and political implications of each of these outcomes. <br />

The South China Sea in Focus: Clarifying the Limits of Maritime Dispute.<br />
<br />
Satellite imagery and geospatial analysis tools offer an unprecedented opportunity to harness new technologies in order to help resolve boundary disputes. In The South China Sea in Focus: Clarifying the Limits of Maritime Dispute, Gregory Poling uses these tools to provide a first and necessary step toward tackling the overlapping maritime disputes in the South China Sea: determining which waters are and are not in dispute under international law. Mr. Poling uses geographic information system (GIS)based maps to provide an easily understandable benchmark against which policymakers and academics can judge the claims and actions of the South China Sea claimants. Only if the parties to the dispute are willing to clarify their sovereignty claims and agree on what is legally in dispute will they be able to effectively manage tensions and agree to joint development in the region."

Airline flight dispatchers must file flight plans about an hour before push-back from the gate using their best available weather forecasts. FAA traffic managers assess the impact of weather on traffic flows, and, when necessary, implement standard reroutes for groups of flights. Given the uncertainty in weather, standardized reroutes may result in large buffers between flight routes and forecast weather. Weather changes as flights progress along planned routes, and because airline dispatchers and FAA traffic managers are busy, especially during weather events, they may miss workable opportunities for more efficient routes around weather. Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) is a search engine that continuously and automatically analyzes in-flight aircraft in en route airspace and proposes simple route amendments for more efficient routes around convective weather while considering winds aloft, sector congestion, traffic conflicts, and active Special Use Airspace. NASA and American Airlines (AA) are conducting an operational trial of DWR at the AA System Operations Center in Fort Worth, Texas. A key result of the trial is that since airline operators are especially busy during weather events, it is more effective to let the automation identify and alert users to potentially high-value reroute options."

Specifically, we will be discussing theorems regarding differential algebraic groups and groups definable in superstable theories (a generalization of omega-stability). We will discuss three types of theorems: (1) Jordan-H\""older theorems, (2) indecomposability theorems, and (3) results on central extensions.

About the Lecture Series:<br />
In recent years challenging new perspectives for thinking about emotion and music have come from the social sciences and from a focus on music in everyday life. These underline how musics capacity to move us emotionally is intensely bound up with its capacity to move us politically and ethically. Ethnomusicologist Martin Stokes brings a comparative glance at global musics of popular emotional dissent to bear on these perspectives. What kind of work does love do, in these contexts? What claims to justice does it embody? The problem of sentimentalism, he suggests in this wide-ranging series of lectures, is not simply the local struggle over good and bad taste. It concerns how we think about popular culture in relation to the major social transformations of the modern age. Martin Stokes is the King Edward Professor of Music at Kings College, London. His most recent book is The Republic of Love: Cultural Intimacy in Turkish Popular Music (Chicago 2010).<br />
<br />
Biography:<br />

Fassbinder adapts the stark black-and-white universe of film noir and infuses its cynicism with crazy love: actual and soon-to-be corpses get all the hugs in this film. Fassbinder called The American Soldier, made in ten days, the study of a perfect killer. Ricky (Karl Scheydt), in Germany following a stint in Vietnam, is a hired gun holed up in a hotel room waiting for orders that come anonymously from a mob of, as it turns out, cops. As in Fritz Lang, criminals and police are a delicate web. Ricky drives a big convertible, orders whiskey and sex room-service, wears white, moves around in the dark, and will kill anyone. But as the hotel maid (Margarethe von Trotta) laments, Being happy isnt always fun. Fassbinder honors, by naming characters after them, the directors Murnau, Fuller, and Walsch (the added c for crime); and himself appears as Rickys friend from the old days, who asks, What was Vietnam like? Just like here.<br />

The holy whore is cinema; like Godard, Fassbinder wishes to strip the medium of its mystique for the sole purpose of continuing to work in it, contempt and all. With production on 1971s Whity stalled, Fassbinder stuck with his castle-in-Spain location and filmed this jagged chronicle of interpersonal confrontations among the remaining film crew, who, as David Thomson wrote, sweat out their mutual fear and loathing. They are cramped and confined by decor but as restless as a prowling camera, forever being forced into abrasive contact and bitter exchanges. . . . But Holy Whore is also an opportunity for that high style that so often accompanied Fassbinders sour view of people. The picture is sleazy and pessimistic, but it is also formal and elegant. As insult and humiliation mount, so its poisonous tone breaks out in cold beads of humor.<br />

Each institution will display treasures from archival collections, architecture firms and private collections, and host companion programming. Unbuilt San Francisco at the College of Environmental Design is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers a shadow city and phantom skyline. The curators explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. The exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area."

As of 2013, you can put 64 gb of memory in your pocket for $399. <br />
<br />
George Dysons Turings Cathedral tells part of the story of the sixty years between these two milestones, and is also the focus of this years On the Same Page program, which gives the UC Berkeley campus community something to talk about. The program theme is The Dawn of the Computer Age, which refers both to the time period in which the ENIAC and MANIAC computers were created and also to our own day and age, when progress in technology is occurring so fast that we are only beginning to see and understand the repercussions of the computer age. Check the On the Same Page web site (http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu ) for details on the many opportunities for participating in this campus-wide discussion, both online and in person.<br />
<br />
The new exhibit at Moffitt Library celebrates the Dawn of the Computer Age and features copies of two of Alan Turings most influential journal articles, a Tiny Turing Machine, images of early computing machines, a live view of the campus Turing Test Tournament, a video of Professor Christos Papadimitriou of the Computer Science department explaining the significance of Turings work, and a brief history of personal computer hardware (PDP-8, anyone?)."

"Unbuilt San Francisco: Ambition and Imagination, thru Nov 8",2013-10-19,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69692&date=2013-10-19,"In many ways, the purest and most potent buildings are the ones that never came to pass: the concept that shows the desire of the moment and, in turn, shines a light on the culture in which it was born. That's the moment being explored from a variety of perspectives in Unbuilt San Francisco: Ambition and Imagination. <br />
<br />
At its most basic, the exhibition is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers the shadow city and phantom skyline that never came to be, for better and for worse. In the process, we explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. <br />
<br />
Co-curated by design critic John King and EDA Curator Waverly Lowell, the exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago."

"Gazing into Nature, thru Oct 20",2013-10-19,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67215&date=2013-10-19,"We are delighted to present, for the first time in ten years, a selection of BAM/PFAs earliest Chinese paintings. These rare and amazingly well-preserved works by early landscape and bird-and-flower painters of the late Song and early Yuan periods (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), rendered on silk or paper with ink and light color, demonstrate the sophistication and accomplishment of the early Chinese painting tradition.<br />
<br />
Early Chinese painters often depicted the natural world through a lens of gentle mists created by delicate brushwork. Whether capturing a refined corner of the universe, as in Ma Yuans thirteenth-century Plum Tree and Ducks by a Stream, or a single twisted branch of a grapevine, as in Wen Riguans thirteenth-century Grapes, it is the artists control of ink, wash, and line that brings the subject to life. Equally compelling is the anonymous Fish and Water Plants from the fifteenth century, which depicts a powerful carp rising through a bed of delicately rendered vegetation; the very light touches of color in this work add a pleasing naturalism to the scene.<br />
<br />
Landscape painters, too, conveyed the beauty and grandeur of the natural world. Their interpretations were not intended to be of specific places rendered in realistic terms, but rather idealized landscapes of retreat and reclusion. The tall trees of Guo Mins Fir and Pines in the Snow (thirteenth century) form a protective circle around a figure pictured in a hut at the base of a fantastic and turbulent mountain. The artist concedes that man is but a small part of a much grander universe. Similarly, River Landscape, attributed to Ma Wan (1325-1365), suggests the glory of the natural world with a remote view that allows the viewer to survey the landscape of mountains, trees, and streams.<br />
<br />
This fall at BAM/PFA, you have a wonderful opportunity to see how the rich painting tradition established by these early artists, especially the careful observation of the natural world, continues to inform and inspire with the exhibition Yang Fudong: Estranged Paradise.<br />
<br />

Gazing into Nature is organized by Senior Curator for Asian Art Julia M. White."
"Deities, Demons, and Teachers of Tibet, Nepal, and India, thru Apr 13, 2014",2013-10-19,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67216&date=2013-10-19,"Joyful and sensual sculptural figures of Indian deities and dancers join radiant images of enlightened beings from Tibet and Nepal in Deities, Demons, and Teachers, which presents a rotating display of works by anonymous Indian, Nepalese, and Tibetan artisans. A tenth-century sandstone figure of Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity worshipped by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, graces the entrance to the exhibition, a site appropriate to Ganeshas role in removing obstacles and blessing any new endeavor. Whether viewed as a cosmic dancer or a cavorting adolescent, this image of Ganesha is confirmation of the wonder and delight to be found in the sculpture and painting of these ancient cultures.<br />
<br />
Hindus and Buddhists both revere and celebrate female deities and often depict goddesses in idealized form with exaggerated marks of beauty. In Dancing Devi, a twelfth-century buff-sandstone sculpture from central India, the beauty of the bejeweled and crowned figure is accentuated by the larger-than-life proportions of breasts and buttocks. A more reserved but no less beautifully idealized feminine form is seen in Tara, a seventeenth-century Nepalese bronze, where the figure is surrounded by a fanciful garden of birds, musicians, and garlands.<br />
<br />
Very early images of the Buddha are rare, so it is quite exceptional that in addition to the massive bronze fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddha in the center of the gallery, this exhibition also features a stone image of a third-century seated Buddha from the Swat Valley and a tenth- or eleventh-century bronze Standing Buddha from Western Tibet. An array of bodhisattvas and attendant deities from these regions, including a painting of the Thirteenth Karmapa (at left), believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, fill out the gathered celestial realm of the Buddhist cosmology.<br />

This presentation showcases approximately fifteen paintings made by the artist over the last two decades, highlighting her more recent series of adornment and branded paintings, which conflate the surface textures of the painting with various aspects of the female body, primarily flesh. The artist drips and meticulously builds layers of thick oil paint in her modestly scaled works, the largest of which measure three feet square and the smallest seven inches square. She engages with the physical aspects of paint, repeatedly turning the canvas on its side to build up a dense network of layers, which sometimes appear more sculptural than painterly.<br />
<br />
Stark frequently spends several years working on her luscious surfaces, underscoring the temporal and material properties of oil paint.<br />
<br />
Inspired by transcendent, universal themes, as well as common utilitarian patterns, stark has created a distinctive body of work organized around central motifs: spirals, rotations, weave patterns, fountains, flames, crosses, flesh, animals, and water. The female body, shown in abstracted close-ups, has been a particular focus of her oeuvre, as witnessed in diverse representations of female genitalia and other fragmented body parts (belly buttons, hair, nipples, tattoos, etc.). Yet for all her attention to the surface of the painting, what inevitably manifests is a deeply felt interest in human psychology and spiritual, or even supernatural, subjects. stark filters these concerns through a playful pop aesthetic, often producing a cheerful yet disturbing affect."
"Yang Fudong, thru Dec 8",2013-10-19,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=68529&date=2013-10-19,"This first midcareer survey of the work of Yang Fudong (b. 1971) presents films, multichannel videos, and photographs by a leading figure in Chinas contemporary art world and independent cinema movement.<br />
<br />
Yangs work reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation born during and after the Cultural Revolution that is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China. Although he draws much of his subject matter from the consumerist contexts of contemporary urban China, many of his images recall the literati paintings of seventeenth-century China (Yang first trained in painting before switching to photography and filmmaking). His films and film installations have an atemporal and dreamlike quality, marked by long and suspended sequences, dividing narratives, and multiple relationships and storylines. In his recent installations, Yang reflects on the process of filmmaking itself, creating spatially open-ended multichannel films that he calls a contemporary form of the Chinese hand scroll.<br />
<br />
Our presentation of Yangs work includes twenty years of photographs and video and film installations in the galleries; a film series at the PFA Theater co-curated by the artist that focuses on works that have influenced him, ranging from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema of the 1930s and 1940s to the Fifth Generation filmmakers who rose to prominence in the 1980s; and a continuous loop of Yangs single-channel films daily at midday in the Museum Theater. <br />

Less appreciated is the fact that this organism has provided a living test tube in which to discover many of the fundamental functions necessary for all life. These processes include many of considerable importance for understanding the underlying basis of human diseases, and for producing therapeutic agents used clinically in human medicine. How research in yeast, much of it conducted here at UC Berkeley, has contributed to our understanding and treatment of asthma, cancer, diabetes and malaria will be discussed.<br />

"Harry Bowden, American Modern, thru Oct 19",2013-10-19,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69522&date=2013-10-19,"Harry Bowden, American Modern is an exhibition of the paintings, drawings and photographs of the Bay Area artist Harry Bowden (1907-1965), who began his artistic career studying at the University of California, Berkeley under the tutelage of Hans Hoffmann. Bowden followed Hoffmann to New York in 1932 and became a founding member of American Abstract Artists in 1936. Bowden exhibited in New York often in group and solo shows during the 30s, but he left for Sausalito in 1942, where he spent the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Bowdens paintings reflect the prevailing currents of his generation, such as an engagement with the development of modern European masters, as well as an early fascination with abstraction that developed over a decade before he returned to figurative painting. This selection of his paintings is supplemented here by a trove a figure studies in pastel, pencil and gouache that he made c. 1950. A group of photographs provide a window on a lifetime practice that resulted in a series of photographic books, murals, and his work being collected and exhibited by the Museum of Modern Art in 1951. Though Bowden never achieved the renown of some of his peers, his works demonstrate an avid imagination, accomplished technique, and a willingness to experiment in multiple mediums.<br />

<br />
<br />
Mamma Roma captures the dispirited world of a spirited prostitute and her efforts to rise above her trade toward a petit bourgeois life for herself and her grown son. In stone ruins and suburban housing projects, Pasolini finds a combination of the seamy and the lyric, the ugly and the classical, rough trade tempered by raw beauty. His dreamlike edits open neorealism to a transcendent modernity, though the film sears with reality. Pasolini, who rarely used professional actors (I choose actors for what they are and not for what they pretend to be), questioned using Anna Magnani. Nevertheless, as Mamma Roma walks the streets giving young johns what they wanther stories; gives her pimp ex-husband (Franco Citti) his due in ribald song; or dances a tango with her soon-to-be martyred son, its hard to picture anyone but Magnani in the role.<br />

"BareStage Presents: ""Almost Maine"", Oct 18-27",2013-10-19,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=70617&date=2013-10-19,"Almost, Maine tells the story of ten friends and couples one night in the mythical town of Almost in northern Maine on a cold winters night. The genre is magical-realism, yet the play is comedic, cleverly commenting both on lifes little beautie's and the times where beauties can fall short. In one scene, new lovers hold hands for the first time; in another, a hitchhiker carrying pieces of her heart in a bag bids good-bye to her dead husband; in yet another, Northern Mainers get drunk in a bar while others struggle to keep their marriage going. Through these stories, Cariani ultimately paints a charming and moving picture of the nature of love. <br />
Shows are at 8pm friday and Saturday & 5pm on Sunday"

(Porcile). One of Pasolinis most difficult films, Pigsty is made up of two parts that are intercut throughout the film. In Orgia (Orgy), set in a seemingly timeless Dark Age, Pierre Clementi plays a young outcast reduced by hunger to cannibalism. Porcile (Pigsty) is set in contemporary West Germany. Jean-Pierre Laud plays the son of a powerful industrialist with Nazi ties. Unable to join or rebel against a world that repulses him, he indulges in his fetish for pigs. Clementi is ultimately set out as hyena fodder by an angry populace, while Laud is devoured by his porcine companions. Rosalind Delmar wrote for Monthly Film Bulletin: It is certainly not a naturalistic film about cannibalism and bestiality, but much more about consumption and consciousness. . . . Innocence, guilt, expiation, human isolation, the relation between social determination and human will, are again (Pasolinis) themes. On the films U.S. premiere at the New York Film Festival in 1969, Richard Roud noted, What is certain is its compulsive and disturbing beauty. It may be unlovable, but it is triumphantly unforgettable. <br />
