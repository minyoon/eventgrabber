"Unbuilt San Francisco, thru Nov 8",2013-10-18,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=68957&date=2013-10-18,"The Environmental Design Archives, AIA San Francisco, Center for Architecture + Design, California Historical Society, SPUR and the San Francisco Public Library are pleased to present Unbuilt San Francisco, a collaborative exhibition on view August  December, 2013. This ambitious five-venue exhibition and its accompanying programs will provide San Franciscans and Bay Area residents with an opportunity to confront visions for the region that never came to be.<br />
<br />
Each institution will display treasures from archival collections, architecture firms and private collections, and host companion programming. Unbuilt San Francisco at the College of Environmental Design is a vivid history lesson, showing viewers a shadow city and phantom skyline. The curators explore why a building does not take brick-and-mortar form, from economic hubris to community resistance, and how an unrealized structure can shape what follows. The exhibition is also intended to engage the students who will make up an important part of the visitors to the gallery. A section on ""First Takes"" explores the early incarnations of buildings that do exist, a way of exploring the passage from ideal to incarnation. ""Rhetorical Unbuilt"" looks at the other extreme of architecture -- plans meant to put new ideas before the public, stir debate and prod us to consider other ways of living in an age that faces environmental and societal pressures we could not have considered a century ago. One of the most fascinating designs in the show is a 1969 plan to fill the Sutro Bath ruins with condominiums -- exactly the sort of proposal that spurred the ""green"" activism of the era and helped spawn the Golden Gate National Recreation Area."
"Holy Land, California, thru Dec 13",2013-10-18,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=69005&date=2013-10-18,"In 1974, the Judah L. Magnes Museum commissioned Albert Garvey (Chicago, 1932), a photographer, printmaker, and graphic designer then based in Fairfax, California, to create a portfolio of views of contemporary Israel. This commission, unconventional for its time, resulted in the work, We Are the Wall Itself, a collection of twenty-four even more unconventional serigraphs (color silkscreen prints), based on images taken by the artist and his wife, Barbara, first in 1960 and again in the spring of 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War.<br />
<br />
Starting from over one thousand 35mm. photographs, altered in the darkroom and combined with hand-drawn stencils, Garvey depicted religious gatherings, the walls and the streets of Jerusalem, the urbanization of Eilat, agricultural work in the kibbutz, and the emerging youth counterculture.<br />
<br />
By presenting a selection from the original project, we are revisiting two sets of cultural conventions: those connected to the artistic practice of imaging the Holy Land, as well as the ways in which the State of Israel has commonly been portrayed since its founding in 1948. Emblematic of the unique view of modern Israel that emerged out of California in the 1960s and early 1970s, Garveys eye seized Israels diversity through the lenses of a then popular form of Pop Art (screen printing), distant from the tropes that had until then marked its representation in America and elsewhere. Rather than glorifying military might, agricultural advancements, and archeological treasures, these images offer a direct appreciation for the daily life of a developing country in which multiple cultures continually negotiated their forms of coexistence.<br />

The exhibition includes over one hundred individual items, many of which were never catalogued before.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a dynamic collecting campaign conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, The Magnes became one of the world's most extensive repositories of materials about the Jews of Southern India, along with the historic sites in Kerala and national and private collections in Israel, where most of the Kerala Jews settled after the founding of the State in 1948.<br />
<br />
The collection includes hundreds of ritual objects, textiles, photographs, archival records, Hebrew books, and manuscripts, including liturgical texts, illustrated ketubbot (Jewish marriage contracts) and amulets, in Hebrew, Aramaic, Malayalam, Judeo-Spanish, and English.<br />
<br />
These materials constitute an invaluable source of information on the Kerala Jewish community, one of the oldest in the world, and its deep connections with Indias society and cultures and with the global Jewish Diaspora, across India, the Middle East, and Europe. Among the most notable items on display are the Torah Ark from the Tekkumbhagam synagogue in Mattancherry, Kochi, and an extremely rare amulet on parchment, designed to protect women in childbirth and newborn children.<br />
<br />
This exhibition is the culmination of years of curatorial work devoted to assessing and documenting the holdings of The Magnes Collection, conducted in collaboration with experts in Israel and the US. It also inaugurates a new season of research, engaging the scholarly community at UC Berkeley and beyond, and intersecting Jewish and Asian Studies.<br />

Dallas was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up surrounded by great music, the famous Kansas City blues and jazz. Music had a profound effect on him as a young man, but he discovered his true talent in painting after his move to Berkeley, California in 1963. He earned a BFA from UC Berkeley in 1974.<br />
<br />
Currently living and painting in Oakland, Dallas is a versatile painter who incorporates calligraphy, figure studies and abstract painting into his work. A traveler whenever possible, Dallas has visited more than 25 countries. During his travels to Japan he studied calligraphy, woodblock printing, handmade paper and Sumi ink brush painting with master artist Toshi Yoshida. Yet, music remains an important part of his practice and he paints almost exclusively while listening to jazz. His two-handed, brushless style of painting is unique; he calls his style artmatism. The divine principle of true artmatism painting is to be in a constant state of enlightenment, states Dallas. Freedom first, then comes enlightenment, and with that enlightenment you understand division and separation of the imaginations. <br />
<br />
Dallas has exhibited throughout the Bay Area and the United States. His work is found in private collections throughout the world, including Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. He was recently included in The Kinsey Collection: Shared Treasures of Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, an exhibition at San Franciscos Museum of the African Diaspora."

These rare and amazingly well-preserved works by early landscape and bird-and-flower painters of the late Song and early Yuan periods (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), rendered on silk or paper with ink and light color, demonstrate the sophistication and accomplishment of the early Chinese painting tradition.<br />
<br />
Early Chinese painters often depicted the natural world through a lens of gentle mists created by delicate brushwork. Whether capturing a refined corner of the universe, as in Ma Yuans thirteenth-century Plum Tree and Ducks by a Stream, or a single twisted branch of a grapevine, as in Wen Riguans thirteenth-century Grapes, it is the artists control of ink, wash, and line that brings the subject to life. Equally compelling is the anonymous Fish and Water Plants from the fifteenth century, which depicts a powerful carp rising through a bed of delicately rendered vegetation; the very light touches of color in this work add a pleasing naturalism to the scene.<br />
<br />
Landscape painters, too, conveyed the beauty and grandeur of the natural world. Their interpretations were not intended to be of specific places rendered in realistic terms, but rather idealized landscapes of retreat and reclusion. The tall trees of Guo Mins Fir and Pines in the Snow (thirteenth century) form a protective circle around a figure pictured in a hut at the base of a fantastic and turbulent mountain. The artist concedes that man is but a small part of a much grander universe. Similarly, River Landscape, attributed to Ma Wan (1325-1365), suggests the glory of the natural world with a remote view that allows the viewer to survey the landscape of mountains, trees, and streams.<br />
<br />
This fall at BAM/PFA, you have a wonderful opportunity to see how the rich painting tradition established by these early artists, especially the careful observation of the natural world, continues to inform and inspire with the exhibition Yang Fudong: Estranged Paradise.<br />

"Deities, Demons, and Teachers of Tibet, Nepal, and India, thru Apr 13, 2014",2013-10-18,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=67216&date=2013-10-18,"Joyful and sensual sculptural figures of Indian deities and dancers join radiant images of enlightened beings from Tibet and Nepal in Deities, Demons, and Teachers, which presents a rotating display of works by anonymous Indian, Nepalese, and Tibetan artisans. A tenth-century sandstone figure of Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity worshipped by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, graces the entrance to the exhibition, a site appropriate to Ganeshas role in removing obstacles and blessing any new endeavor. Whether viewed as a cosmic dancer or a cavorting adolescent, this image of Ganesha is confirmation of the wonder and delight to be found in the sculpture and painting of these ancient cultures.<br />
<br />
Hindus and Buddhists both revere and celebrate female deities and often depict goddesses in idealized form with exaggerated marks of beauty. In Dancing Devi, a twelfth-century buff-sandstone sculpture from central India, the beauty of the bejeweled and crowned figure is accentuated by the larger-than-life proportions of breasts and buttocks. A more reserved but no less beautifully idealized feminine form is seen in Tara, a seventeenth-century Nepalese bronze, where the figure is surrounded by a fanciful garden of birds, musicians, and garlands.<br />
<br />
Very early images of the Buddha are rare, so it is quite exceptional that in addition to the massive bronze fourteenth-century Tibetan Buddha in the center of the gallery, this exhibition also features a stone image of a third-century seated Buddha from the Swat Valley and a tenth- or eleventh-century bronze Standing Buddha from Western Tibet. An array of bodhisattvas and attendant deities from these regions, including a painting of the Thirteenth Karmapa (at left), believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, fill out the gathered celestial realm of the Buddhist cosmology.<br />

<br />
Yangs work reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation born during and after the Cultural Revolution that is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China. Although he draws much of his subject matter from the consumerist contexts of contemporary urban China, many of his images recall the literati paintings of seventeenth-century China (Yang first trained in painting before switching to photography and filmmaking). His films and film installations have an atemporal and dreamlike quality, marked by long and suspended sequences, dividing narratives, and multiple relationships and storylines. In his recent installations, Yang reflects on the process of filmmaking itself, creating spatially open-ended multichannel films that he calls a contemporary form of the Chinese hand scroll.<br />
<br />
Our presentation of Yangs work includes twenty years of photographs and video and film installations in the galleries; a film series at the PFA Theater co-curated by the artist that focuses on works that have influenced him, ranging from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema of the 1930s and 1940s to the Fifth Generation filmmakers who rose to prominence in the 1980s; and a continuous loop of Yangs single-channel films daily at midday in the Museum Theater. <br />

This idea only becomes more than a loose analogy, though, if there is a theory of communication that can add something substantial to our understanding of memory. I'll argue that recent models of communication, developed for quite different applications, can indeed play this role. Application of these ideas to memory can inform debates about the 'reconstructive' nature of memory, the function of episodic memory, and the relations between memory in genetic, epigenetic, and neural systems."

Bowden followed Hoffmann to New York in 1932 and became a founding member of American Abstract Artists in 1936. Bowden exhibited in New York often in group and solo shows during the 30s, but he left for Sausalito in 1942, where he spent the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Bowdens paintings reflect the prevailing currents of his generation, such as an engagement with the development of modern European masters, as well as an early fascination with abstraction that developed over a decade before he returned to figurative painting. This selection of his paintings is supplemented here by a trove a figure studies in pastel, pencil and gouache that he made c. 1950. A group of photographs provide a window on a lifetime practice that resulted in a series of photographic books, murals, and his work being collected and exhibited by the Museum of Modern Art in 1951. Though Bowden never achieved the renown of some of his peers, his works demonstrate an avid imagination, accomplished technique, and a willingness to experiment in multiple mediums.<br />

In it, she asks you to disengage from some of your most cherished notions of love: that it is exclusive, lasting, and unconditional. In synthesizing behavioral, psychophysiological, and neural data from multiple laboratories, Fredrickson reveals how love  defined as micro-moments in which positivity resonates between and among people  can build enduring resources, such as wisdom, community, and even physical health. Making the case that love creates physical health, Fredrickson describes results from recent randomized controlled trials from her PEP Lab, in which people learn how to self-generate feelings of love and compassion. She and her team find that cardiac vagal tone forecasts peoples day-to-day experiences of love, and that by learning to self-generate love more frequently, people can further improve their vagal tone, and with it, their mental and physical health. This upward spiral dynamic explains how fleeting experiences of positive connection can accumulate and compound to set people on trajectories toward health. More generally, Fredricksons fresh take on love offers practical approaches to strengthening your relationships, teams, and communities."

Unfortunately, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are subject to substantial inherent imperfections that pose major obstacles to the design of robust and very large-scale CNFET digital systems:<br />
<br />
 It is nearly impossible to guarantee perfect alignment and positioning of all CNTs. This limitation introduces stray conducting paths, resulting in incorrect circuit functionality.<br />
<br />
 CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting depending on chirality. Metallic CNTs cause shorts resulting in excessive leakage and incorrect circuit functionality.<br />

A combination of design and processing technique overcomes these challenges by creating robust CNFET digital circuits that are immune to these inherent imperfections. This imperfection-immune design paradigm enables the first experimental demonstration of the carbon<br />

""The US Rebalance to Asia and the South China Sea Dispute""<br />
<br />
The United States calls itself a resident Pacific power. US President Barack Obama has in recent years reinvigorated American strategic influence in the region through a pivot or rebalance to Asia. This talk assesses how and the extent to which the US rebalancing has impacted the South China Sea disputes. The South China Sea is at the center of competing territorial, economic, and strategic interests. The issue is complicated by the number of disputants. While the claimants to the Paracel Islands are the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam, six states assert ownership over the Spratly Islands and/or their surrounding waters, namely, Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The presentation first examines the origins and main characteristics of the US rebalancing to Asia before describing the traditional American position on the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. It argues that the United States has not taken sides in the disputes and has restricted its interest to the preservation of the freedom of navigation. It then discusses whether and to what extent Washington has changed its position in recent years in response to renewed Chinese assertiveness in the disputed waters. It also reviews regional responses to the US involvement and concludes by assessing its impact on the peaceful management of the South China Sea disputes.<br />

""Chinas Marine Policy on Asserting Sovereignty over Islands in East and South China Seas: Legal and Political Perspectives""<br />
<br />
Observing from the heated developments over the Diaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea with Japan and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea with the Philippines and Vietnam, it is a common criticism what China has done in enhancing its maritime claims is through coercion and intimidation towards its neighbours. Is it really so? Also, what kind of policy tools that China operates to express its determination in maintaining sovereignty over those islands? <br />

""The Philippines Arbitral Proceedings Against China on the South China Sea Disputes: Latest Developments and Legal Implications""<br />
<br />
Sabre-rattling and confrontations at sea. Claim and counter-claim. Protest and counter-protest. Undoubtedly, the South China Sea has been the stage of one of the most complex international disputes in recent years. The sovereignty dispute between multiple state actors over small offshore features in the South China Sea and the accompanying claims to maritime resources surrounding such features have long been a flashpoint for tension in the region. The technical and legal questions are complicated enough but coupled with the competing threads of nationalism, history and big power geopolitics that are inherent in the South China Sea disputes, a long-term solution does not appear to be in sight. <br />
<br />
In 2012, in an unprecedented move that took the international community by surprise, the Philippines initiated arbitral proceedings against China under Annex VII of UNCLOS over the latters claims in the South China Sea, including the validity of Chinas u-shaped line. Opinion is divided on whether the Philippines course of action will move the disputes towards a peaceful resolution or whether it will exacerbate an already precarious situation. In this regard, the Seminar will give an overview of the Philippines-China arbitral proceedings and will outline the latest developments. It will then explore possible outcomes of the arbitral proceedings and discuss the legal and political implications of each of these outcomes. <br />

The South China Sea in Focus: Clarifying the Limits of Maritime Dispute.<br />
<br />
Satellite imagery and geospatial analysis tools offer an unprecedented opportunity to harness new technologies in order to help resolve boundary disputes. In The South China Sea in Focus: Clarifying the Limits of Maritime Dispute, Gregory Poling uses these tools to provide a first and necessary step toward tackling the overlapping maritime disputes in the South China Sea: determining which waters are and are not in dispute under international law. Mr. Poling uses geographic information system (GIS)based maps to provide an easily understandable benchmark against which policymakers and academics can judge the claims and actions of the South China Sea claimants. Only if the parties to the dispute are willing to clarify their sovereignty claims and agree on what is legally in dispute will they be able to effectively manage tensions and agree to joint development in the region."

Airline flight dispatchers must file flight plans about an hour before push-back from the gate using their best available weather forecasts. FAA traffic managers assess the impact of weather on traffic flows, and, when necessary, implement standard reroutes for groups of flights. Given the uncertainty in weather, standardized reroutes may result in large buffers between flight routes and forecast weather. Weather changes as flights progress along planned routes, and because airline dispatchers and FAA traffic managers are busy, especially during weather events, they may miss workable opportunities for more efficient routes around weather. Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) is a search engine that continuously and automatically analyzes in-flight aircraft in en route airspace and proposes simple route amendments for more efficient routes around convective weather while considering winds aloft, sector congestion, traffic conflicts, and active Special Use Airspace. NASA and American Airlines (AA) are conducting an operational trial of DWR at the AA System Operations Center in Fort Worth, Texas. A key result of the trial is that since airline operators are especially busy during weather events, it is more effective to let the automation identify and alert users to potentially high-value reroute options."

About the Lecture Series:<br />
In recent years challenging new perspectives for thinking about emotion and music have come from the social sciences and from a focus on music in everyday life. These underline how musics capacity to move us emotionally is intensely bound up with its capacity to move us politically and ethically. Ethnomusicologist Martin Stokes brings a comparative glance at global musics of popular emotional dissent to bear on these perspectives. What kind of work does love do, in these contexts? What claims to justice does it embody? The problem of sentimentalism, he suggests in this wide-ranging series of lectures, is not simply the local struggle over good and bad taste. It concerns how we think about popular culture in relation to the major social transformations of the modern age. Martin Stokes is the King Edward Professor of Music at Kings College, London. His most recent book is The Republic of Love: Cultural Intimacy in Turkish Popular Music (Chicago 2010).<br />

Fassbinder adapts the stark black-and-white universe of film noir and infuses its cynicism with crazy love: actual and soon-to-be corpses get all the hugs in this film. Fassbinder called The American Soldier, made in ten days, the study of a perfect killer. Ricky (Karl Scheydt), in Germany following a stint in Vietnam, is a hired gun holed up in a hotel room waiting for orders that come anonymously from a mob of, as it turns out, cops. As in Fritz Lang, criminals and police are a delicate web. Ricky drives a big convertible, orders whiskey and sex room-service, wears white, moves around in the dark, and will kill anyone. But as the hotel maid (Margarethe von Trotta) laments, Being happy isnt always fun. Fassbinder honors, by naming characters after them, the directors Murnau, Fuller, and Walsch (the added c for crime); and himself appears as Rickys friend from the old days, who asks, What was Vietnam like? Just like here.<br />

The genre is magical-realism, yet the play is comedic, cleverly commenting both on lifes little beautie's and the times where beauties can fall short. In one scene, new lovers hold hands for the first time; in another, a hitchhiker carrying pieces of her heart in a bag bids good-bye to her dead husband; in yet another, Northern Mainers get drunk in a bar while others struggle to keep their marriage going. Through these stories, Cariani ultimately paints a charming and moving picture of the nature of love. <br />

"Beware of a Holy Whore, Oct 18",2013-10-18,http://events.berkeley.edu/index.php/calendar/sn/pubaff.html?event_ID=68900&date=2013-10-18,"(Warnung vor einer heiligen Nutte). The holy whore is cinema; like Godard, Fassbinder wishes to strip the medium of its mystique for the sole purpose of continuing to work in it, contempt and all. With production on 1971s Whity stalled, Fassbinder stuck with his castle-in-Spain location and filmed this jagged chronicle of interpersonal confrontations among the remaining film crew, who, as David Thomson wrote, sweat out their mutual fear and loathing. They are cramped and confined by decor but as restless as a prowling camera, forever being forced into abrasive contact and bitter exchanges. . . . But Holy Whore is also an opportunity for that high style that so often accompanied Fassbinders sour view of people. The picture is sleazy and pessimistic, but it is also formal and elegant. As insult and humiliation mount, so its poisonous tone breaks out in cold beads of humor.<br />
